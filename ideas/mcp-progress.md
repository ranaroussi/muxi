# MCP Handler Development Progress

## Current Implementation Status

- **MCP Handler Refactoring**: MUXI has successfully refactored the MCPHandler class to use the official MCP SDK:
  - Replaced the tool-based implementation with the SDK-based approach
  - Connected to Python SDK from Model Context Protocol (mcp package)
  - Basic implementation of server connections
  - Message processing with tool call support
  - Context management for conversations
  - Error handling for common issues

- **Transport Support**:
  - Created placeholder classes for HTTP+SSE and Command-line transports
  - Basic integration with the MCP Client from the SDK
  - Foundation ready for proper transport implementations

- **Agent Integration**:
  - Agent class integrates with the new MCPHandler
  - Support for connecting to and disconnecting from MCP servers
  - Method to get available MCP servers
  - Processing messages through the handler

- **SDK Integration Challenges**:
  - The official SDK has a different module structure than initially expected
  - Main client is at `mcp.client.session.ClientSession` instead of `modelcontextprotocol.client.MCPClient`
  - JSON-RPC components are available directly from the `mcp` module
  - Transport implementations need to be custom-built as they're not directly provided by SDK

## Development Resources

### External MCP Servers for Testing

> **Note**: MUXI is only responsible for communicating with MCP servers, not creating or running them.

For development and testing, we need access to:

1. **HTTP+SSE MCP Servers**
   - mcpify.ai server: `https://server.mcpify.ai/sse?server=6ebcc255-021f-443b-9be3-02233ee4ea41` (Confirmed working)
   - MCP servers that expose HTTP endpoints with Server-Sent Events `https://router.mcp.so/sse/4ertmsm8erwh60`
   - Example: Custom HTTP servers that implement the MCP specification
   - Example: Self-hosted server instances with HTTP+SSE transport

2. **Command-line MCP Servers**
   - Brave Search MCP server: `npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search`
   - Calculator MCP server: `npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-calculator`
   - Other npx-based MCP servers
   - Examples that use stdin/stdout communication

3. **Streamable HTTP Servers** (for future)
   - Monitor the MCP specification PR #206 for final implementation details
   - Will need example servers when available

### Development Tools

- Mock MCP servers for unit testing
- HTTP client library with SSE support (httpx)
- Process management library for command-line servers (asyncio.subprocess)
- The official MCP Python SDK (from GitHub)

## MCP Server Examples

### Running Brave Search MCP Server (Command-line)

```bash
# Install and run the Brave Search MCP server
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search
```

This will start the Brave Search MCP server as a command-line process. You can connect to it using:

```python
await agent.connect_mcp_server(
    name="search",
    url_or_command="npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search",
    transport_type="command_line",
    credentials={"api_key": "YOUR_BRAVE_API_KEY"}
)
```

### Running Calculator MCP Server (Command-line)

```bash
# Install and run the Calculator MCP server
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-calculator
```

This runs the calculator server and waits for input on stdin. You would connect to it using:

```python
await agent.connect_mcp_server(
    name="calculator",
    url_or_command="npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-calculator",
    transport_type="command_line"
)
```

### HTTP+SSE Server Example (Custom HTTP Server)

For HTTP+SSE servers that expose REST endpoints and Server-Sent Events, you would connect as follows:

```python
await agent.connect_mcp_server(
    name="http_server",
    url="http://localhost:3000",
    transport_type="http_sse",
    credentials={"api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY"}
)
```

### Testing the Connection

After connecting to an MCP server, you can test the connection by making a basic request:

```python
# Command-line example (Brave Search)
message = {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "search",
    "params": {
        "query": "current weather in San Francisco"
    },
    "id": "1"
}

# Send message to MCP server
client = agent.mcp_handler.active_connections["search"]
response = await client.send_message(method="search", params={"query": "current weather in San Francisco"})
print(response)
```

This should return search results based on the query.

## Official MCP Python SDK Integration

We're now using the official Python SDK for Model Context Protocol (MCP) from [github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk).

### SDK Integration Status

- ✅ SDK now installed from PyPI (`mcp>=1.4.1`) instead of GitHub
- ✅ Basic client implementation using the SDK's session class
- ✅ JSON-RPC request handling implemented
- ✅ Created placeholder transport classes for HTTP+SSE and command-line
- ✅ Basic MCPHandler tests working with the new implementation
- ✅ Updated Agent to use the new MCPHandler

### SDK Structure Notes

The MCP Python SDK has a different structure than we initially expected:

- Main client is at `mcp.client.session.ClientSession`
- JSON-RPC components are directly in the `mcp` module (e.g., `mcp.JSONRPCRequest`)
- Transport implementations need to be custom built as they're not directly provided by the SDK

### Transport Implementation Plan

We need to implement proper transport classes for:

1. **HTTP+SSE Transport**:
   - Creating HTTP connections to the `/message` endpoint
   - Setting up SSE listeners on the `/sse` endpoint
   - Managing credentials and session state

2. **Command-Line Transport**:
   - Spawning and managing child processes
   - Sending messages via stdin
   - Reading responses from stdout
   - Handling process lifecycle

## HTTP+SSE Transport Implementation Status

We've worked on implementing the HTTP+SSE transport for the MCP handler, with several challenges and findings:

1. **MCP SDK Evolution**: The Model Context Protocol Python SDK has evolved since our initial implementation. The current SDK has different initialization requirements than what we originally expected.

2. **API Compatibility**: The current `MCPClient` (from `mcp.client.session.ClientSession`) requires memory streams for communication rather than a transport object. We've updated our implementation to create and manage these streams.

3. **Server Connection Challenges**: We've encountered HTTP 405 "Method Not Allowed" errors when attempting to connect to the MCP server at the URL we're testing with. This suggests:
   - The server URL format might be incorrect
   - The HTTP methods or endpoints we're using don't match the server's expectations
   - Additional headers or authentication might be required

4. **Implementation Approach**: Given these findings, we've:
   - Updated the `HTTPSSETransport` to use direct HTTP requests
   - Modified the `MCPServerClient` to properly manage memory streams
   - Simplified the `MCPHandler` interface to focus on core functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Resolve Server Connection Issues**:
   - Research the correct URL format and endpoints for MCP servers
   - Verify HTTP methods, headers, and authentication requirements
   - Consider reaching out to the MCP development team for specific guidance

2. **Simplify Our Implementation**:
   - Consider a more direct approach that doesn't require complex memory stream management
   - Test with a known working MCP server, if available

3. **Documentation and Testing**:
   - Document our findings and implementation challenges
   - Create comprehensive tests to verify functionality once we resolve connection issues

## Transport Implementation

The HTTP+SSE transport implementation has been updated to handle memory streams and provide a simpler interface, but still requires additional work to properly connect to MCP servers.

## Integration Challenges and Solutions

See our detailed notes on integration challenges and solutions in the file: `tests/mcp_integration_notes.md`

# HTTP+SSE Connection Update

We have successfully connected to the mcpify.ai MCP server using HTTP+SSE transport. Here's what we learned:

## Connection Flow

1. **Initial SSE Connection**:
   - Connect to the `/sse` endpoint with proper headers:
     ```
     Accept: text/event-stream
     Cache-Control: no-cache
     Connection: keep-alive
     ```
   - The server responds with a 200 OK and starts streaming events

2. **Endpoint Discovery**:
   - The server sends an SSE event with `event: endpoint`
   - The data contains the message endpoint URL including the session ID:
     ```
     data: /messages?server=SERVER_ID&sessionId=SESSION_ID
     ```
   - This URL must be used for all subsequent JSON-RPC requests

3. **Request Handling**:
   - All requests are sent as POST to the endpoint URL
   - JSON-RPC requests need the `jsonrpc: "2.0"` field
   - The server responds with a 202 Accepted for async processing
   - Responses come through the SSE stream rather than direct HTTP responses

## Key Insights

1. **URL Construction**: The message URL is provided fully formed by the server, including the session ID and server ID parameters. We should not attempt to build this URL ourselves.

2. **Asynchronous Nature**: The MCP server follows a fully asynchronous model:
   - Requests get 202 Accepted status codes
   - Actual responses come through the SSE stream
   - This requires maintaining an active SSE connection

3. **Headers Matter**: Proper SSE headers are required for stable connections:
   - `Accept: text/event-stream`
   - `Cache-Control: no-cache`
   - `Connection: keep-alive`

4. **Timeout Handling**: Longer timeouts are needed for SSE connections (60s vs standard 30s)

## Updated Implementation

We've created a reference implementation in `tests/mcp_updated_transport.py` that successfully:

1. Connects to the mcpify.ai server
2. Extracts the message endpoint URL and session ID
3. Sends JSON-RPC requests and receives 202 Accepted responses
4. Handles connection cleanup

This implementation provides a solid foundation for integrating with the `MCPHandler` class.

## Next Steps

1. **Integrate with MCPHandler**: Update the `HTTPSSETransport` in `mcp_handler.py` based on our successful implementation
2. **Event Processing**: Add proper SSE event processing to handle responses to our requests
3. **Error Handling**: Improve error handling and reconnection logic
4. **Documentation**: Update documentation to reflect the actual MCP server behavior

## Testing

The updated implementation successfully passes the following tests:
- Connecting to the SSE endpoint
- Extracting the message URL and session ID
- Sending ping requests
- Sending method-specific requests (get_current_weather)

All requests receive 202 Accepted responses, indicating that the server is processing them asynchronously, and responses would come through the SSE stream.
