# MCP Handler Development Progress

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration Progress

### Current Implementation Status

- ✅ **MCPHandler Refactoring**: Successfully refactored the MCPHandler class to use the official MCP SDK
- ✅ **Transport Support**: Implemented both HTTP+SSE transport and command-line transport
- ✅ **Enhanced Features**:
  - ✅ Transport factory for managing different transport types
  - ✅ Cancellation support for long-running operations
  - ✅ Improved diagnostic information
  - ✅ Reconnection with exponential backoff implemented and tested
- ✅ **Agent Integration**: Agent class now successfully integrated with the new MCP handler

### Transport Support

#### HTTP+SSE Transport

Implemented a robust HTTP+SSE transport for connecting to MCP servers that support this transport type. The transport includes:

- Proper SSE event parsing
- HTTP request handling for sending JSON-RPC requests
- Event lifecycle management (connect, listen, send, disconnect)

#### Command-Line Transport

Implemented a command-line transport for connecting to local MCP servers that are executable binaries. The transport includes:

- Subprocess management
- STDIN/STDOUT communication
- Process lifecycle management

### Enhanced Features

#### Transport Factory

Created a `MCPTransportFactory` that centralizes transport creation based on the transport type. This improves:

- Code organization with a proper factory pattern
- Simplified client code that doesn't need to know transport details
- Extension point for adding new transport types in the future

#### Reconnection with Exponential Backoff

Implemented a robust reconnection mechanism with exponential backoff:

- Created a dedicated `ReconnectingMCPHandler` that extends `MCPHandler`
- Implemented `RetryConfiguration` for configurable retry behavior
- Added comprehensive retry statistics and diagnostics
- Automatic reconnection when disconnected
- Support for exponential backoff with configurable parameters
- Jitter support to prevent thundering herd problem

Full test suite created to validate reconnection behavior with:
- Connection retry scenarios
- Execution retry scenarios
- Reconnection timing and backoff verification

#### Cancellation Support

Added cancellation support to allow interrupting in-progress MCP operations:

- Implemented `CancellationToken` class
- Modified `execute_tool` method to accept a cancellation token
- Added utility methods to cancel all in-progress operations

#### Improved Diagnostics

Enhanced error handling and diagnostic information:

- Custom exception types for different error scenarios
- Detailed error messages
- Connection statistics method
- Real-time monitoring of operation status

### SDK Integration Progress

- ✅ Successfully integrated official MCP Python SDK
- ✅ SDK now available on PyPI
- ✅ SDK included in requirements.txt
- ✅ Tests written for core SDK functionality

### HTTP+SSE Connection Success

Successfully connected to the mcpify.ai MCP server using HTTP+SSE transport. The connection flow is as follows:

1. Create an HTTP+SSE transport instance with the server URL
2. Connect to the server by establishing an SSE connection
3. Start listening for SSE events in a background task
4. Send JSON-RPC requests over HTTP POST
5. Process received SSE events as responses

Key insights from the connection:
- URLs must be properly constructed with the correct paths
- SSE connection is asynchronous and requires a separate task
- HTTP requests require specific headers and content-type
- Timeouts need careful consideration
