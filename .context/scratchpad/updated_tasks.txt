# MUXI Framework Updated Task Priorities

The MUXI Framework development will now focus on the following tasks in order of priority:

## 1. REST API & MCP Server Implementation
Implement the full REST API for MUXI based on the api.md specifications, including:
- Standard REST API endpoints (agent management, conversation management, memory operations)
- Authentication with API keys
- Streaming support for chat endpoints with SSE
- Proper error handling with standardized format
- API versioning support
- Rate limiting and throttling
- API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger

## 2. WebSocket API Implementation
Enhance the WebSocket API based on api.md specifications:
- WebSocket protocol for real-time communication
- Support for multi-modal messages (text, images, audio)
- Proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Reconnection logic with exponential backoff
- Support for attachments as specified in api.md

## 3. CLI Interfaces
Improve command-line interfaces for better user experience:
- Add support for all API operations described in api.md
- Improve formatting and user experience
- Add multi-modal interaction support
- Implement configuration management commands

## 4. Web UI
Develop a comprehensive web interface for the framework:
- Create responsive UI for mobile and desktop
- Implement real-time updates using WebSocket
- Add support for multi-modal interactions
- Build user-friendly configuration interface
- Create agent management dashboard

## 5. Agent-to-Agent Communication
Implement the A2A protocol for inter-agent communication:
- Capability discovery mechanism
- Task delegation between agents
- Context sharing with proper isolation
- Conversation lifecycle management
- External agent integration
- Security and authentication

## 6. Vector Database Enhancements
Improve vector database support and performance:
- Optimize vector operations for improved performance
- Add support for additional vector databases (Milvus, Qdrant, etc.)
- Add migration tools for transferring between database types
- Create performance benchmarks for different vector database options
- Develop guidance for choosing between SQLite and PostgreSQL
- Support for vector database clustering and sharding

## 7. LLM Providers
Expand support for various LLM providers:
- Implement Anthropic LLM provider
- Implement Gemini LLM provider
- Implement Grok LLM provider
- Add support for local models (Llama, Mistral, DeepSeek)
- Create a model router for fallback and cost optimization

## 8. Testing and Documentation
Comprehensive testing and documentation:
- Unit tests for all new API endpoints
- Integration tests for API and WebSocket endpoints
- Performance benchmarks for API endpoints
- Complete CLI documentation
- Expand API documentation beyond api.md with practical examples
- User guides for advanced use cases
- Example projects showcasing API usage

## 9. Deployment & Package Distribution
Ensure proper deployment options and package distribution:
- Docker containerization
- Kubernetes deployment
- Cloud deployment guides (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Monitoring and logging integration
- Continuous integration workflow with GitHub Actions
- Automatic version bumping for releases
- SQLite deployment guides for serverless and edge environments

## 10. Language-Specific SDKs
Develop SDKs for popular programming languages:
- TypeScript/JavaScript SDK for web and Node.js
- Go SDK for backend integration
- Java/Kotlin SDK for Android and JVM environments
- C#/.NET SDK for Windows integration
- Rust SDK for systems programming
- SDK Development Tools (API client generators, shared test suite)

## 11. Multi-Modal Capabilities
Add support for multi-modal capabilities:

### Document Processing
- PDF and Office document support
- OCR for scanned documents
- Document summarization

### Image Processing
- Image attachment support
- Image preprocessing pipeline
- Vision-capable model integration

### Audio Processing
- Audio file handling
- Speech-to-text integration
- Text-to-speech for responses
- Streaming audio capabilities

## 12. Security Enhancements
Enhance security features:
- API security (rate limiting, input validation, IP restrictions)
- Advanced authentication methods (OAuth, OIDC, role-based access)
- Data protection (encryption at rest and in transit)
- Security auditing and vulnerability scanning
- Privacy controls and data protection mechanisms
