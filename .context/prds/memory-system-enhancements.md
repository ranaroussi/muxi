# Memory System Enhancements PRD

## Overview

This document outlines the planned enhancements to the memory systems in the MUXI Framework. While the core memory architecture has been successfully implemented with centralized orchestrator-level memory management, support for PostgreSQL with pgvector and SQLite with sqlite-vec, and multi-user support through Memobase, several additional features and optimizations are required to fully realize the framework's capabilities.

## Goals

- Enhance the flexibility and organization of context memory
- Improve performance of vector operations across all database backends
- Complete the memory-related REST API endpoints
- Support multi-modal content in memory systems
- Provide tools for data migration between different vector database backends
- Implement automatic user information extraction from conversations
- Create an interface-level user ID generation system

## Non-Goals

- Implementing additional vector database backends beyond PostgreSQL and SQLite (deprioritized based on performance evaluations)
- Creating specialized memory structures for domain-specific applications
- Building custom vector database engines

## User Stories

1. As a developer, I want to use predefined context memory templates so that I can quickly set up common user information patterns.
2. As a developer, I want to organize context memory into namespaces so that I can maintain clear separation between different types of user data.
3. As a system administrator, I want to migrate data between different vector database backends so that I can scale my deployment as needed.
4. As a developer, I want my agents to automatically extract and remember important user information without explicit programming.
5. As an end-user, I want the system to remember my preferences across sessions even if I don't explicitly log in.
6. As a developer, I want to search across different modalities (text, images, etc.) in the memory system.

## Requirements

### 1. Context Memory Templates

**Description:** Implement predefined templates for common context memory use cases to standardize data organization and simplify development.

**Requirements:**
- Create a template system for defining common context memory structures
- Include standard templates for user preferences, personal information, and session data
- Support template inheritance and extension for customization
- Add validation for template-based data
- Provide documentation and examples for creating custom templates

**Technical Considerations:**
- Templates should be definable in both code and configuration files (YAML/JSON)
- Implementation should minimize performance overhead

### 2. Context Memory Namespaces

**Description:** Develop a namespace system to organize different types of context data with appropriate access controls.

**Requirements:**
- Implement hierarchical namespaces for context memory organization
- Add support for querying data across multiple namespaces
- Create access control mechanisms for namespace-level permissions
- Support namespace-specific configuration options
- Develop utilities for namespace management (creation, deletion, listing)

**Technical Considerations:**
- Namespaces should map efficiently to database structures
- Implementation should preserve backward compatibility with existing code

### 3. Memory API Endpoints

**Description:** Complete the REST API endpoints for memory operations as specified in api.md.

**Requirements:**
- Implement context memory CRUD operations via REST API
- Create endpoints for memory search with filtering and pagination
- Add endpoints for memory extraction settings management
- Implement bulk operations for memory management
- Add proper documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger

**Technical Considerations:**
- API design should follow RESTful principles
- Include proper validation for all endpoints
- Support both synchronous and streaming responses where appropriate

### 4. Performance Optimizations

**Description:** Optimize vector operations and memory access for improved performance.

**Requirements:**
- Optimize vector similarity search operations
- Implement advanced caching for frequently accessed memory entries
- Add query optimization for large-scale memory stores
- Create performance benchmarks for different scenarios
- Support batch operations for memory insertions

**Technical Considerations:**
- Optimizations should be compatible with both PostgreSQL and SQLite backends
- Include configuration options to tune performance parameters

### 5. Migration Tools

**Description:** Develop tools for transferring data between different vector database backends.

**Requirements:**
- Create command-line tools for memory data migration
- Support incremental migration to minimize downtime
- Implement data validation during migrations
- Add schema evolution capabilities for backward compatibility
- Provide detailed logging and reporting for migration operations

**Technical Considerations:**
- Tools should handle large datasets efficiently
- Support resumable migrations in case of interruption

### 6. Multi-Modal Memory Capabilities

**Description:** Extend memory systems to support image, audio, and document content.

**Requirements:**
- Add support for storing and retrieving multi-modal content
- Implement cross-modal search capabilities
- Create efficient storage mechanisms for binary data
- Support content type detection and automatic processing
- Integrate with WebSocket for multi-modal streaming

**Technical Considerations:**
- Utilize appropriate embedding models for different content types
- Ensure database compatibility for binary storage
- Implement efficient serialization/deserialization

### 7. Automatic User Information Extraction

**Description:** Enhance and optimize the already implemented MemoryExtractor system that automatically identifies and stores important user information from conversations.

**Requirements:**
- Improve performance of the existing MemoryExtractor integration with Agent and Orchestrator classes
- Enhance entity recognition accuracy for various information types
- Implement more sophisticated confidence scoring and conflict resolution for contradictory information
- Add configurable extraction thresholds and sensitivity controls
- Develop advanced privacy controls including better PII detection and handling
- Implement performance optimizations including tiered model selection

**Technical Considerations:**
- Further optimize extraction to minimize impact on conversation latency
- Evaluate and implement specialized extraction models based on confidence requirements
- Enhance GDPR compliance with more sophisticated data handling practices

### 8. Interface-Level User ID Generation

**Description:** Implement a system for automatic user identification across different interfaces that enables personalization when explicit user IDs aren't provided.

**Requirements:**
- Create core UserIdentifier interface and strategies for REST API, WebSocket, and CLI
- Implement persistent storage for user ID mapping
- Develop privacy-preserving fingerprinting techniques
- Add middleware for automatic ID injection into request contexts
- Create configuration system for ID generation behavior
- Integrate with memory systems for consistent access

**Technical Considerations:**
- Balance uniqueness with privacy in ID generation
- Support both stateful and stateless operation modes
- Ensure secure storage of mapping data

### 9. Vector Database Enhancements

**Description:** Enhance the vector database implementations with advanced features for scalability and performance.

**Requirements:**
- Add support for clustering and sharding in PostgreSQL
- Implement advanced indexing strategies
- Create database-specific optimizations based on usage patterns
- Develop guidance for database selection based on deployment scenarios
