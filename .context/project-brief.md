# MUXI Framework Project Brief

## Project Overview

MUXI Framework is a versatile Python framework for building AI agents and Multi-Agent systems. It provides a solid foundation for creating advanced AI applications through a unified architecture that integrates multiple interfaces and capabilities.

## Core Objectives

1. Create a powerful, flexible framework for AI agent development
2. Support multi-agent architectures with intelligent routing
3. Provide robust memory systems for contextual interactions
4. Enable seamless integration with external tools via MCP servers
5. Support multiple interfaces (REST API, WebSockets, CLI, Web UI)
6. Offer declarative configuration for easy setup and deployment
7. Create a modular, extensible architecture

## Key Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Multi-Agent Support**: Create and manage multiple specialized AI agents
2. **Memory Systems**: Implement short-term and long-term memory for context retention
3. **MCP Server Integration**: Connect to external services via Model Context Protocol
4. **Multiple Interfaces**: Support REST API, WebSockets, CLI, and Web UI
5. **Intelligent Message Routing**: Direct messages to the appropriate agent
6. **Multi-User Support**: Enable user-specific memory partitioning
7. **Context Memory**: Store structured user information for personalization
8. **Knowledge Base**: Provide agents with specialized domain knowledge
9. **Hybrid Communication**: Support HTTP, SSE, and WebSockets

### Technical Requirements

1. **Modularity**: Architecture should be component-based
2. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new capabilities and interfaces
3. **Configurability**: Support YAML and JSON configuration files
4. **API-First**: Design with API-driven development approach
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage
6. **Documentation**: Complete developer and user documentation
7. **Distribution**: Proper Python packaging for PyPI
8. **Performance**: Efficient handling of concurrent requests

## Project Scope
