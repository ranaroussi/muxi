# Automatic User Information Extraction: Implementation Plan

## Overview

We'll enhance the MUXI Framework with automatic user information extraction capabilities that allow agents to automatically identify, categorize, and store important information about users from conversations. This system will build rich user profiles over time without requiring explicit code to manage each piece of information.

## Key Features

1. **Automatic Extraction**: Process conversations to identify key user information
2. **Confidence Scoring**: Assign confidence levels to extracted information
3. **Categorization**: Organize information into appropriate categories
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Handle contradictory information intelligently
5. **Privacy Controls**: Support opt-out, data retention, and sensitive information handling
6. **Model Selection**: Allow specification of extraction model for cost optimization
7. **Configurable Behavior**: Control extraction frequency, confidence thresholds, and categories

## Implementation Process

### Phase 1: Core Implementation

1. Create the `MemoryExtractor` class in `packages/server/src/muxi/memory/extraction.py`
   - Implement conversation processing
   - Add extraction prompt engineering
   - Implement model selection support
   - Add confidence scoring

2. Integrate with Agent & Orchestrator
   - Update `Agent.process_message()` to trigger extraction
   - Modify Orchestrator to support extraction configuration
   - Implement user message counter for extraction intervals

3. Update MUXI Facade
   - Add configuration parameters for extraction
   - Add documentation for new parameters

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features

4. Implement Conflict Resolution
   - Add logic for handling contradictory information
   - Implement category-specific conflict resolution

5. Add Privacy Controls
   - Implement opt-out mechanisms
   - Add sensitive information filtering
   - Create data retention policies

6. Optimize Performance
   - Implement caching for extraction results
   - Add batch processing for multi-turn analysis
   - Optimize for minimal latency impact

### Phase 3: Testing & Documentation

7. Create Comprehensive Tests
   - Unit tests for extraction accuracy
   - Integration tests with memory systems
   - Performance benchmarks

8. Update Documentation
   - Add examples and usage guides
   - Document best practices
   - Create API reference

## Model Selection for Cost Optimization

A key feature of this implementation is the ability to specify which model is used for extraction, separate from the model used for conversation. This allows developers to optimize costs by:

1. Using a lower-cost model (e.g., GPT-3.5-Turbo) for extraction while using a higher-capability model (e.g., Claude-3-Opus) for conversations
2. Configuring extraction interval to reduce the number of extraction operations
3. Setting appropriate confidence thresholds to prevent storing uncertain information

Example configuration:

```python
from muxi import muxi
from muxi.core.models.openai import OpenAIModel

# Create a dedicated extraction model for cost optimization
extraction_model = OpenAIModel(
    api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",  # Lower-cost model for extraction
)

# Initialize MUXI with custom extraction settings
app = muxi(
    buffer_memory=100,
    long_term_memory="sqlite:///memory.db",
    is_multi_user=True,
    auto_extract_context=True,             # Enable extraction
    extraction_model=extraction_model,     # Use specific model for extraction
    extraction_confidence=0.8,             # Higher confidence threshold
    extraction_interval=3,                 # Process every 3rd message
)
```

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. Information is accurately extracted with 85%+ accuracy for high-confidence items
2. The system properly handles conflicts and contradictions
3. Performance impact is less than 15% additional latency
4. Developers can specify and control model selection for cost optimization
5. Privacy controls are comprehensive and effective
6. The system integrates seamlessly with existing memory management
