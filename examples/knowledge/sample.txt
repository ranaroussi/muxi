The MUXI Framework is an open-source toolkit for building AI assistants and agents. It provides a flexible architecture for creating both simple and complex AI systems.

Key features of the MUXI Framework include:
1. Agent-based architecture
2. Memory systems for short-term and long-term context
3. Knowledge integration for domain-specific information
4. Multi-agent collaboration capabilities
5. Tool integration for enhanced capabilities

MUXI agents can be created using both declarative and programmatic approaches. The declarative approach uses YAML configuration files, while the programmatic approach uses Python code.

The framework supports multiple LLM providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Azure OpenAI. It also supports local models for privacy-focused applications.

Best practices for using the MUXI Framework:
- Start with a simple agent before adding complexity
- Use memory for maintaining context in conversations
- Add knowledge sources for domain-specific expertise
- Consider multi-agent systems for complex tasks
- Implement proper error handling and logging
