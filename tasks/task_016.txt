# Task ID: 16
# Title: Enhance MCPService with Performance Monitoring and Load Balancing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement performance monitoring metrics and load balancing capabilities to the centralized MCPService singleton to optimize resource utilization and improve system reliability.
# Details:
The MCPService has been successfully implemented as a thread-safe singleton with configurable timeouts, comprehensive error handling, support for multiple transport types, and proper documentation. Now we need to enhance it with:

1. Performance Monitoring:
   - Implement counters for tracking request rates, response times, and error rates
   - Add configurable thresholds for performance metrics
   - Create a monitoring dashboard integration point
   - Implement periodic logging of performance statistics

2. Load Balancing:
   - Develop an algorithm to distribute requests across available resources
   - Implement connection pooling for transport types that support it
   - Add circuit breaker pattern to handle failures gracefully
   - Implement backpressure mechanisms to prevent system overload

3. Health Checks:
   - Add self-diagnostic capabilities to verify service health
   - Implement periodic connectivity tests to dependent services
   - Create a health status reporting endpoint

Ensure all new features maintain the existing thread safety guarantees and follow the established error handling patterns. Update the documentation in rules to reflect these new capabilities.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Tests:
   - Create tests for each new monitoring metric to verify accurate counting
   - Test load balancing algorithm with simulated loads to verify even distribution
   - Verify circuit breaker functionality under various failure scenarios
   - Test health check functionality in normal and degraded states

2. Integration Tests:
   - Verify performance monitoring under realistic load conditions
   - Test load balancing with actual service dependencies
   - Validate that backpressure mechanisms prevent system overload

3. Performance Tests:
   - Conduct load testing to verify the service maintains performance under high load
   - Measure overhead introduced by monitoring to ensure it's minimal
   - Test recovery scenarios after induced failures

4. Validation Criteria:
   - Performance metrics should be accurate within 1% margin of error
   - Load balancing should distribute requests with no more than 10% variance
   - Circuit breaker should trigger after configured number of failures
   - System should maintain stability under 2x expected peak load
