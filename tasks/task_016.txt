# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Interface-Level User ID Generation System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement a system for automatic user identification across different interfaces (REST API, WebSocket, CLI) that enables personalization and memory features even when explicit user IDs aren't provided.
# Details:
Create a comprehensive user identification system following the specifications in prd-interface-user-id.md:

1. Design a `UserIdentifier` interface with methods for:
   - Generating new user IDs
   - Retrieving existing user IDs
   - Validating user IDs
   - Managing ID persistence

2. Implement interface-specific strategies:
   - REST API: Use session tokens, cookies, or device fingerprinting
   - WebSocket: Leverage connection properties and headers
   - CLI: Use machine identifiers, configuration files, or interactive prompts

3. Integration points:
   - Add middleware/interceptors to automatically inject user IDs into request contexts
   - Modify request handlers to extract and validate user identifiers
   - Implement fallback mechanisms when explicit IDs aren't available

4. Memory system updates:
   - Modify memory storage to index by generated IDs
   - Implement ID resolution and mapping for memory retrieval
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing memory systems

5. Configuration options:
   - ID generation algorithm selection (UUID, sequential, custom)
   - Persistence duration and storage location
   - Privacy controls (anonymization options)
   - Cross-interface ID correlation settings

6. Security considerations:
   - Implement ID encryption or hashing where appropriate
   - Add rate limiting for ID generation requests
   - Create audit logging for ID generation and usage
   - Ensure compliance with relevant privacy regulations

The implementation should be modular, allowing for easy addition of new interface types in the future.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both functional correctness and security aspects:

1. Unit tests:
   - Test each interface-specific implementation against the `UserIdentifier` contract
   - Verify ID generation produces valid, unique identifiers
   - Test persistence and retrieval mechanisms
   - Validate error handling for edge cases

2. Integration tests:
   - Verify automatic ID generation across each interface type
   - Test cross-interface ID resolution (same user across different interfaces)
   - Validate memory system integration with generated IDs
   - Test configuration changes propagate correctly

3. Security tests:
   - Verify IDs cannot be easily forged or predicted
   - Test rate limiting functionality
   - Ensure proper encryption/hashing of sensitive ID data
   - Validate privacy controls work as expected

4. Performance tests:
   - Benchmark ID generation under load
   - Measure memory retrieval performance with generated IDs
   - Test system behavior with large numbers of concurrent users

5. Manual verification:
   - Verify personalization features work with generated IDs
   - Test user experience across multiple sessions
   - Validate that memory features correctly associate data with the right users

All tests should be automated where possible and included in the CI/CD pipeline.
