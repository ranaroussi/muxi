# Task ID: 12
# Title: Develop Language-Specific SDKs
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 10
# Priority: low
# Description: Create SDKs for TypeScript/JavaScript, Go, Java/Kotlin, C#/.NET, and Rust with shared development tools.
# Details:
Develop TypeScript/JavaScript SDK for web and Node.js. Create Go SDK for backend integration. Implement Java/Kotlin SDK for Android and JVM environments. Build C#/.NET SDK for Windows integration. Develop Rust SDK for systems programming. Create shared API client generators and test suites. Implement consistent error handling across SDKs. Add documentation and examples for each SDK. Set up package distribution for each language's ecosystem.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for each SDK. Develop integration tests that verify API compatibility. Test examples in each SDK. Verify package installation process. Create cross-language test scenarios to ensure consistent behavior.
