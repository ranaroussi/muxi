For default profile handling:\n   - Store the default profile name in a special `[DEFAULT]` section of the config file\n   - When no profile is specified in commands, implement logic to:\n     a. Check for a `--profile` flag first\n     b. If not present, read the default profile from config\n     c.

The configuration system will use INI-style format (not YAML) similar to AWS CLI, Azure CLI, and other popular command-line tools:\n   ```ini\n   [DEFAULT]\n   current_profile = production\n   \n   [profile development]\n   region = us-west-2\n   output = json\n   \n   [profile production]\n   region = us-east-1\n   output = text\n   ```\n\n2. Configuration file structure:\n   - Each profile will be stored in its own section with the prefix \"profile \" (e.g., \"[profile development]\")\n   - The [DEFAULT] section will store global settings including the current default profile name\n   - Common settings will be stored directly as key-value pairs within each profile section\n   - Sensitive information will be referenced but stored securely using keyring\n\n3. Default profile management:\n   - Users can set a profile as default during creation with a simple flag:\n     ```\n     muxi config create-profile development --set-default\n     ```\n   - The default profile can be changed later:\n     ```\n     muxi config set-default-profile production\n     ```\n   - When no profile is specified in commands, the default profile is automatically used\n   - Visual indicators in CLI output will show which profile is currently active\n\n4. Profile inheritance can be implemented to allow profiles to extend settings from other profiles, reducing duplication for similar environments.\n</info added on 2025-05-03T14:22:45.123Z>\n</info added on 2025-05-02T10:15:08.544Z>",

Testing for permission handling:\n   - Test permission checks with various user roles\n   - Verify correct permission indicators in help text and command listings\n   - Test permission-based filtering of commands\n</info added on 2025-05-02T10:02:14.719Z>\n\n<info added on 2025-05-02T10:15:42.196Z>\n<info added on 2025-05-03T15:30:22.103Z>\nEnhanced permission visibility and user experience implementation:\n\n1. Permission-based command visibility:\n   - Implement a configuration-driven visibility system that dynamically shows/hides commands based on user role\n   - Add a `visibleTo` property in command metadata (values: 'admin', 'user', 'public', or array combinations)\n   - Create middleware that filters command availability in help menus and tab completion\n\n2. Advanced terminal output styling:\n   - Implement consistent color scheme using ANSI color codes: \n     * Admin commands: bold red (#FF3333)\n     * User commands: amber (#FFBF00)\n     * Public commands: teal (#33CCCC)\n   - Add permission badges with unicode symbols (🔒 for admin, 🔑 for user, 🌐 for public)\n   - Support terminal color configuration via `.muxirc` file for accessibility\n\n3. Progressive disclosure in help documentation:\n   - Implement tiered help text that shows basic usage for all users\n   - Add `--verbose` flag to reveal advanced options requiring higher permissions\n   - Create contextual help that suggests alternative commands when permission checks fail\n\n4. User-friendly permission errors:\n   - Design hierarchical error messages with 3 components:\n     * Clear error headline (\"Permission Denied: Admin privileges required\")\n     * Explanation of why the action is restricted\n     * Actionable next steps (e.g., \"Contact your administrator or try 'muxi resource view' instead\")\n   - Add `--simulate` flag for admin-only commands that lets users preview command behavior without execution\n   - Implement error code system for programmatic handling (e.g., E_PERM_ADMIN, E_PERM_USER)\n\n5. Permission elevation workflows:\n   - Add temporary permission elevation via time-limited tokens\n   - Implement audit logging for all permission-related events\n   - Create helper command `muxi permissions request` to formalize elevation requests\n</info added on 2025-05-03T15:30:22.103Z>\n</info added on 2025-05-02T10:15:42.196Z>",
