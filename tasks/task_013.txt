# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Unified MUXI API Server with Multi-Protocol Support
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement the core MUXI API that integrates REST API, SSE streaming, Model Context Protocol (MCP), and WebRTC signaling with authentication leveraging the MUXI Core authentication system as specified in the PRD.
# Details:
Create a unified server architecture that serves as the foundation for all client interactions with MUXI. The implementation should:

1. Support multiple communication protocols:
   - REST API endpoints for standard request/response interactions
   - Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time data streaming to clients, including logging and tracing
   - Model Context Protocol (MCP) for specialized device communication using FastAPI_MCP
   - WebRTC signaling for peer-to-peer connections

2. Leverage MUXI Core authentication:
   - Validate requests against API keys sent to the MUXI Core
   - Implement explicit access level specification for each endpoint using decorators or dependency injection
   - Enforce permission validation across all protocols

3. Create a modular architecture that:
   - Uses a shared core for authentication, logging, and security
   - Maintains protocol-specific handlers that implement the appropriate interfaces
   - Provides unified error handling and response formatting
   - Includes comprehensive request logging and monitoring
   - Assigns explicit operation_id for MCP tool names to each endpoint

4. Ensure the server is:
   - Horizontally scalable to handle increasing load
   - Configurable via environment variables and config files
   - Properly documented with API specifications
   - Containerized for easy deployment

5. Deployment considerations:
   - The MUXI API must be initialized with a configurable URI of the MUXI Core (defaults to localhost:3000) to allow distributed installation
   - Documentation must include best practices for production deployment behind reverse proxies like Caddy/Traefik

The implementation will completely replace the existing API code with NO backward compatibility requirements. All clients will need to migrate to the new API structure. The implementation should follow the architectural diagrams in the PRD and adhere to the security requirements specified for each protocol type.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify all aspects of the unified server implementation:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Test each protocol handler independently
   - Verify authentication logic with MUXI Core authentication
   - Test access level enforcement via decorators/dependency injection
   - Test error handling for each protocol

2. Integration Tests:
   - Verify cross-protocol functionality
   - Test authentication across different protocols
   - Ensure proper resource sharing between protocol handlers
   - Verify FastAPI_MCP integration for Model Context Protocol
   - Test configuration of MUXI Core URI and connection handling

3. Load Testing:
   - Simulate multiple concurrent connections across protocols
   - Verify server performance under high load
   - Test horizontal scaling with multiple server instances

4. Security Testing:
   - Verify API key validation against MUXI Core
   - Test access level enforcement for different endpoint permissions
   - Verify proper isolation between different access levels
   - Test for common vulnerabilities (injection, XSS, etc.)

5. Protocol-Specific Tests:
   - REST API: Test all endpoints with various inputs and verify operation_id assignments
   - SSE: Verify event streaming for logging and tracing based on the tracing system PRD
   - MCP: Test FastAPI_MCP integration with Model Context Protocol
   - WebRTC: Verify signaling functionality with test clients

6. Deployment Tests:
   - Verify functionality when deployed behind various reverse proxies (Caddy, Traefik)
   - Test different MUXI Core URI configurations
   - Validate containerized deployment in various environments

All tests should be automated and included in the CI/CD pipeline. Documentation should include examples of using each protocol with the server.

Implementation details:
1. Create authentication middleware to validate API keys against the MUXI service
2. Implement decorators or dependency injection for explicit access level specification
3. Develop permission enforcement logic based on access levels

<info added on 2025-05-01T22:22:57.213Z>
Additional information:

The API Server will leverage the existing MUXI service authentication system rather than implementing its own key generation or storage mechanisms. Authentication will be handled through:

1. Integration with MUXI's API key validation endpoints via HTTP client
2. Implementation of FastAPI-compatible authentication methods:
   - Function decorators (e.g., `@app.verify_user_key`)
   - Dependency injection (e.g., `dependencies=[Depends(verify_user_key)]`)
3. Creation of access level specification utilities that:
   - Parse MUXI-provided JWT tokens or API key metadata
   - Extract role/permission information from MUXI authentication responses
   - Map MUXI permission structures to API Server endpoint requirements
4. Development of a permission verification layer that:
   - Validates incoming requests against MUXI-provided API keys
   - Enforces access control based on endpoint-specific requirements
   - Handles authentication failures with appropriate error responses

The authentication flow will maintain a clear separation of concerns, with the API Server acting as a client to the MUXI authentication service rather than managing credentials directly.

## 3. Develop Core REST API Endpoints [pending]

2. The operation_id must be documented in both the code and OpenAPI specification to maintain consistency.

3. This implementation will completely replace the existing API codebase with no backward compatibility considerations. All clients will need to migrate to the new API structure.

Implementation of SSE Endpoints:

1. Create dedicated endpoints:
   - `/api/v1/logs/stream` - For application logs streaming
   - `/api/v1/traces/stream` - For trace events streaming

2. Endpoint query parameters for filtering:

   - `service=<service-name>` - Filter by originating service
   - `traceId=<trace-id>` - Filter events belonging to specific trace
   - `spanId=<span-id>` - Filter events belonging to specific span
   - `from=<timestamp>` - Filter events after timestamp
   - `limit=<number>` - Limit number of events per batch

3. Event format structure:
   ```
   event: log
   id: <event-unique-id>
   data: {"timestamp":"2023-06-15T10:30:45Z","level":"info","message":"User login successful","service":"auth-service","traceId":"abc123"}

   event: trace
   id: <event-unique-id>

   - Buffer up to 1000 most recent events per connection
   - Implement catch-up mechanism using `Last-Event-ID` header
   - Use Redis pub/sub for horizontal scaling of SSE connections

5. Rate limiting considerations:
   - Implement token bucket algorithm (100 events/second per client)

<info added on 2025-05-01T22:22:37.176Z>
The subtask already correctly refers to MCP as "Model Context Protocol" in both the title and description. I'll add specific details about the FastAPI_MCP library implementation and operation_id requirements:

Implementation notes:
- The FastAPI_MCP library provides a standardized way to expose model capabilities as tools through the Model Context Protocol
- Each API endpoint must be decorated with an explicit `operation_id` that will serve as the MCP tool name in the protocol
- Example endpoint definition:
  ```python
  @app.post("/device/command", operation_id="send_device_command")
  async def send_command(command: DeviceCommand):
      # Implementation
  ```
- The operation_id must follow MCP naming conventions: lowercase with underscores, descriptive of the operation
- Implement the required MCP discovery endpoint that returns all available tools and their schemas
- Ensure all tool schemas are properly documented using Pydantic models for automatic OpenAPI generation
- Configure FastAPI_MCP to handle both synchronous and asynchronous tool execution patterns
