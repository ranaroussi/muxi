# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Automatic User Information Extraction System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a system that automatically identifies and extracts key user information from conversations and stores it in the user context memory for future reference.
# Details:
Create a module that processes conversation content to identify and extract relevant user information based on the patterns defined in the PRD. The implementation should:

1. Build an extraction pipeline with the following components:
   - Entity recognition system to identify personal information (names, locations, preferences, etc.)
   - Information categorization to classify extracted data (personal details, preferences, important dates, etc.)
   - Confidence scoring mechanism to rate the reliability of extracted information
   - Conflict resolution for handling contradictory information

2. Develop pattern recognition capabilities that can identify:
   - Direct statements ("My name is...", "I live in...")
   - Implied information ("I'll be traveling to Paris next week")
   - Preference indicators ("I prefer...", "I don't like...")

3. Implement privacy controls including:
   - Configurable sensitivity levels for information extraction
   - Clear opt-out mechanisms
   - Data retention policies compliant with privacy regulations

4. Create an API for:
   - Retrieving extracted user information
   - Managing extracted information (edit, delete, confirm)
   - Configuring extraction sensitivity and categories

5. Develop integration with the existing user context memory system to:
   - Store extracted information in the appropriate format
   - Update information when new details are discovered
   - Handle information retrieval requests

The system should be designed to run in real-time during conversations with minimal latency impact.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the accuracy of information extraction and the system's integration with user context memory:

1. Unit tests:
   - Test entity recognition with various input formats and phrasings
   - Verify categorization logic for different types of user information
   - Test confidence scoring with ambiguous and clear statements
   - Validate privacy filter functionality

2. Integration tests:
   - Verify extracted information is correctly stored in user context memory
   - Test information retrieval API returns accurate data
   - Validate update mechanisms when new/conflicting information is detected

3. Performance tests:
   - Measure extraction latency under various conversation loads
   - Test system performance with concurrent users
   - Benchmark memory usage during extraction operations

4. Accuracy validation:
   - Create a dataset of 100+ conversation snippets with known user information
   - Calculate precision, recall, and F1 scores for the extraction system
   - Target >90% accuracy for high-confidence extractions

5. Privacy compliance tests:
   - Verify opt-out mechanisms properly prevent information extraction
   - Test that sensitive information is handled according to privacy settings
   - Validate data retention policies are correctly implemented

6. End-to-end scenarios:
   - Simulate multi-turn conversations with gradually revealed user information
   - Test extraction across conversation sessions
   - Verify conflict resolution with contradictory information provided over time
