# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Interface-Level User ID Generation System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a system that generates consistent and meaningful user IDs across all interfaces (REST API, WebSocket, CLI) when explicit user IDs are not provided, as specified in the PRD.
# Details:
Create a centralized user ID generation service that works across all interfaces:

1. Implement the core UserIdGenerator service that:
   - Follows the algorithm specified in the PRD document at .context/prds/prd-interface-user-id.md
   - Generates deterministic IDs based on available client information (IP, session, device fingerprints, etc.)
   - Handles collision detection and resolution
   - Includes appropriate privacy protections and anonymization techniques

2. Integrate the UserIdGenerator with each interface:
   - REST API: Extract client information from requests and generate IDs when Authorization header is missing
   - WebSocket: Generate IDs during connection establishment if not provided
   - CLI: Use local environment/config information to generate persistent IDs

3. Implement ID persistence and lookup:
   - Create storage mechanism for mapping generated IDs to client signatures
   - Ensure generated IDs remain consistent for returning users
   - Implement appropriate TTL/expiry policies as specified in the PRD

4. Add configuration options:
   - Enable/disable automatic ID generation
   - Configure ID format and algorithm parameters
   - Set security/privacy thresholds

5. Ensure proper documentation is added for all interfaces explaining the automatic ID generation behavior.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Tests:
   - Test UserIdGenerator with various input combinations
   - Verify deterministic behavior (same inputs produce same IDs)
   - Test collision handling
   - Verify privacy protection mechanisms

2. Integration Tests:
   - For each interface (REST, WebSocket, CLI), verify ID generation when explicit ID not provided
   - Test persistence of generated IDs across multiple requests from same client
   - Verify cross-interface consistency (same client should get same ID regardless of interface)

3. Security Tests:
   - Ensure IDs cannot be manipulated or predicted
   - Verify privacy compliance (no PII in generated IDs)
   - Test ID generation with proxies/VPNs to ensure proper handling

4. Performance Tests:
   - Benchmark ID generation under load
   - Test concurrent ID generation scenarios

5. Specific Test Cases:
   - Anonymous REST API client gets consistent ID across multiple requests
   - WebSocket reconnection preserves user ID
   - CLI commands from same environment maintain user context
   - Client changing IP but with same device fingerprint gets same ID (if configured)
   - Two different clients don't receive the same generated ID
