# Task ID: 17
# Title: Document Package Structure Reorganization from src/muxi to Direct muxi Directories
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Document the completed work of reorganizing package structure from src/muxi to direct muxi directories across all packages, including import path updates and meta package creation.
# Details:
This task documents the completed package structure reorganization work:

1. Directory Structure Changes:
   - Moved all code from src/muxi/* to direct muxi/* directories in all packages
   - Eliminated the src/ intermediate directory to simplify imports and package structure
   - Created a new meta package that provides a unified import point for the muxi ecosystem

2. Import Path Updates:
   - Updated all internal import paths to reflect the new directory structure
   - Changed imports from 'github.com/muxitech/muxi/src/muxi/*' to 'github.com/muxitech/muxi/*'
   - Updated any circular dependencies that may have been affected

3. Documentation Updates:
   - Updated README.md files in each package to reflect the new structure
   - Updated API documentation to reference the correct import paths
   - Added documentation for the new meta package explaining its purpose and usage

4. Build System Changes:
   - Updated build scripts and configuration files to work with the new structure
   - Ensured CI/CD pipelines are compatible with the reorganized structure

This reorganization simplifies the codebase structure, makes imports more intuitive, and better aligns with Go community standards for package organization.

# Test Strategy:
The reorganization has been verified through the following methods:

1. Build Verification:
   - Confirmed all packages build successfully with the new structure
   - Ran 'go build ./...' from the root directory to verify no import errors
   - Verified that the meta package correctly exposes the intended APIs

2. Test Suite Execution:
   - Ran the complete test suite to ensure all tests pass with the new structure
   - Verified that test imports were correctly updated
   - Confirmed test coverage remains at or above previous levels

3. Documentation Review:
   - Manually reviewed all documentation to ensure it reflects the new structure
   - Verified examples in documentation use the correct import paths
   - Confirmed README files accurately describe the new organization

4. Integration Testing:
   - Tested downstream projects that depend on muxi packages to ensure they can update successfully
   - Created migration guides if needed for external consumers of the libraries

5. Import Path Verification:
   - Used grep or similar tools to ensure no references to the old src/muxi path remain in the codebase
