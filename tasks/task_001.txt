# Task ID: 1
# Title: Implement Core REST API Endpoints
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the foundational REST API endpoints for agent management, conversation management, and memory operations as specified in api.md.
# Details:
Implement RESTful endpoints following the api.md specification. Create controllers for agent management (CRUD operations), conversation management (create, retrieve, update conversations), and memory operations. Use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with proper status codes. Ensure JSON response formatting is consistent. Set up routing with proper URL patterns and versioning support (e.g., /v1/agents).

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for each endpoint using a testing framework. Verify correct response codes, payload validation, and error handling. Use mock services to isolate API layer testing.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up API project structure and routing framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational structure for the REST API including project setup, routing configuration, error handling middleware, and API versioning support.
### Details:
1. Initialize the API project structure with appropriate folders (controllers, routes, models, middleware, utils)
2. Set up the main server file with Express.js or similar framework
3. Implement API versioning support (e.g., /v1/)
4. Create middleware for request validation, error handling, and logging
5. Implement standardized response formatting for consistent JSON outputs
6. Configure CORS and security headers
7. Test the base API structure with a simple health check endpoint (/v1/health)
8. Document the project structure for other developers

## 2. Implement Agent Management API endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create the CRUD endpoints for agent management as specified in api.md, including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting agents.
### Details:
1. Create an agent model/schema based on api.md specifications
2. Implement the following endpoints:
   - GET /v1/agents - List all agents
   - GET /v1/agents/:id - Get a specific agent
   - POST /v1/agents - Create a new agent
   - PUT /v1/agents/:id - Update an agent
   - DELETE /v1/agents/:id - Delete an agent
3. Add request validation for each endpoint
4. Implement proper HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, etc.)
5. Write unit tests for each endpoint using Jest or similar
6. Test with Postman or similar tool to verify functionality
7. Document the endpoints with examples

## 3. Implement Conversation Management API endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Develop the endpoints for creating, retrieving, and updating conversations between users and agents.
### Details:
1. Create a conversation model/schema that references agents
2. Implement the following endpoints:
   - GET /v1/conversations - List conversations
   - GET /v1/conversations/:id - Get a specific conversation
   - POST /v1/conversations - Create a new conversation
   - PUT /v1/conversations/:id - Update a conversation
   - GET /v1/conversations/:id/messages - Get messages in a conversation
   - POST /v1/conversations/:id/messages - Add a message to a conversation
3. Ensure proper relationships between conversations and agents
4. Implement pagination for conversation listing and message retrieval
5. Add filtering capabilities (by date, agent, etc.)
6. Write unit tests for each endpoint
7. Test conversation flows end-to-end

## 4. Implement Memory Operations API endpoints [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Create endpoints for managing agent memory operations including storing, retrieving, and updating memory entries.
### Details:
1. Create a memory model/schema that links to agents
2. Implement the following endpoints:
   - GET /v1/agents/:id/memory - Retrieve an agent's memory
   - POST /v1/agents/:id/memory - Add to an agent's memory
   - PUT /v1/agents/:id/memory/:memoryId - Update a specific memory entry
   - DELETE /v1/agents/:id/memory/:memoryId - Delete a memory entry
   - GET /v1/agents/:id/memory/search - Search within an agent's memory
3. Implement memory indexing for efficient retrieval
4. Add query parameters for memory filtering and searching
5. Ensure proper validation of memory entries
6. Write unit tests for memory operations
7. Test memory persistence and retrieval accuracy

## 5. Implement API documentation and integration testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4
### Description: Create comprehensive API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger and implement integration tests to ensure all endpoints work together correctly.
### Details:
1. Generate OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all implemented endpoints
2. Set up an interactive API documentation interface
3. Create integration tests that test complete workflows:
   - Creating an agent, starting a conversation, and storing memory
   - Retrieving conversations with their associated agents
   - Testing memory operations in context of conversations
4. Implement API rate limiting and throttling
5. Add authentication middleware (if required by api.md)
6. Perform load testing to ensure API performance
7. Create example API client code snippets
8. Document error codes and troubleshooting guidance
