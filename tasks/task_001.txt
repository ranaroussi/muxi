# Task ID: 1
# Title: Implement Context Memory Templates
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a template system for defining common context memory structures with support for inheritance, extension, and validation.
# Details:
Develop a template system that allows defining common context memory structures in both code and configuration files (YAML/JSON). Implement standard templates for user preferences, personal information, and session data. Support template inheritance and extension for customization. Add validation for template-based data. The implementation should minimize performance overhead while providing a flexible structure for developers.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for template creation, inheritance, validation, and usage. Develop integration tests to verify template functionality with actual memory storage. Benchmark performance to ensure minimal overhead.
