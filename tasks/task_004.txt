# Task ID: 4
# Title: Optimize Vector Operations Performance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Improve performance of vector similarity search and memory access operations across all database backends.
# Details:
Optimize vector similarity search operations for both PostgreSQL and SQLite backends. Implement advanced caching for frequently accessed memory entries. Add query optimization for large-scale memory stores. Create performance benchmarks for different scenarios. Support batch operations for memory insertions. Include configuration options to tune performance parameters.

# Test Strategy:
Benchmark vector operations before and after optimization to verify 50% performance improvement target. Test with various dataset sizes to ensure scalability. Validate that optimizations work consistently across both PostgreSQL and SQLite backends.
