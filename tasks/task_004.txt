# Task ID: 4
# Title: Enhance CLI Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Improve the command-line interface to support all API operations with better formatting and user experience.
# Details:
Refactor CLI to use a command pattern for all API operations. Add support for multi-modal interactions (text, images, audio). Implement configuration management commands for API keys and preferences. Improve output formatting with colors and structured data. Add progress indicators for long-running operations. Implement interactive mode for conversation. Create help documentation for all commands.

# Test Strategy:
Create automated tests for CLI commands using command execution and output parsing. Test configuration persistence. Verify all API operations can be performed through CLI. Create user acceptance testing script for manual verification.
