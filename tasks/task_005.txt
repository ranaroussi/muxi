# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Migration Tools
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop tools for transferring data between different vector database backends with validation and logging.
# Details:
Create command-line tools for memory data migration between PostgreSQL and SQLite backends. Support incremental migration to minimize downtime. Implement data validation during migrations to ensure 100% data integrity. Add schema evolution capabilities for backward compatibility. Provide detailed logging and reporting for migration operations. Ensure tools handle large datasets efficiently and support resumable migrations in case of interruption.

# Test Strategy:
Test migration between PostgreSQL and SQLite in both directions with various dataset sizes. Verify data integrity after migration. Test interruption and resumption of migration process. Validate schema evolution with different versions.
