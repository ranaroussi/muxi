# Task ID: 2
# Title: Add Authentication and Security for REST API
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement API key authentication, rate limiting, and throttling for the REST API endpoints.
# Details:
Create middleware for API key validation. Implement rate limiting using a token bucket or similar algorithm. Add request throttling to prevent abuse. Create an API key management system with generation, revocation, and permission scoping. Implement proper error responses for authentication failures (401) and rate limit exceeded (429). Store API keys securely with hashing.

# Test Strategy:
Test authentication with valid and invalid API keys. Verify rate limiting by sending requests exceeding the limit. Test API key management operations. Create integration tests that simulate various authentication scenarios.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create API Key Storage and Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a secure storage system for API keys with functionality for generation, hashing, and management
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Design a database schema for storing API keys with fields for: key_id, hashed_key, user_id, created_at, last_used, permissions/scopes, active status, and expiration
2. Implement a secure hashing function using bcrypt or similar algorithm to store API keys
3. Create functions for generating new API keys with configurable length and entropy
4. Implement methods for key revocation (setting active status to false)
5. Add functionality for permission/scope assignment to keys
6. Create admin endpoints for key management (generation, revocation, scope modification)
7. Testing approach: Write unit tests for key generation, hashing, and validation functions; create integration tests for the key management endpoints

## 2. Implement API Key Authentication Middleware [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create middleware to validate API keys for protected endpoints
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create middleware function that extracts API key from request headers, query parameters, or Authorization header
2. Implement key validation logic that checks the provided key against stored hashed keys
3. Add functionality to verify key hasn't expired and is still active
4. Implement permission/scope checking to ensure the key has access to the requested resource
5. Create proper 401 Unauthorized responses with informative error messages for authentication failures
6. Add request logging for authentication attempts (successful and failed)
7. Testing approach: Write unit tests with mock requests containing valid and invalid API keys; test different authentication failure scenarios; ensure proper error responses

## 3. Implement Rate Limiting Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Create a token bucket or similar rate limiting algorithm to restrict API usage
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Research and select appropriate rate limiting algorithm (token bucket recommended)
2. Implement the rate limiting logic with configurable rates per API key or user
3. Create a storage mechanism for tracking request counts (Redis recommended for distributed systems)
4. Implement different rate limit tiers based on user permissions or subscription levels
5. Add headers to responses showing rate limit status (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset)
6. Create 429 Too Many Requests responses when limits are exceeded
7. Testing approach: Write tests that simulate rapid API calls to trigger rate limiting; verify correct headers and 429 responses

## 4. Add Request Throttling Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Implement request throttling to prevent API abuse and ensure service stability
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Design a throttling mechanism that limits concurrent requests from the same client
2. Implement logic to track ongoing requests per API key or IP address
3. Create configurable throttling parameters (max concurrent requests, cool-down period)
4. Add functionality to queue or reject requests that exceed throttling limits
5. Implement proper error responses for throttled requests with retry-after headers
6. Create monitoring for throttling events to detect potential abuse patterns
7. Testing approach: Write tests that simulate concurrent requests to verify throttling behavior; test with different throttling configurations

## 5. Integrate Security Features and Create Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Connect all security components, add global error handling, and create documentation for API security
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Integrate authentication, rate limiting, and throttling middleware into the main application
2. Create a configuration system for security parameters (rate limits, throttling settings, key expiration policies)
3. Implement global error handling for security-related errors with appropriate status codes
4. Add security headers to all API responses (Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)
5. Create comprehensive documentation for API consumers explaining authentication requirements, rate limits, and error codes
6. Implement a developer dashboard showing API usage, rate limit status, and key management
7. Testing approach: Perform end-to-end testing of the complete security system; verify all components work together correctly; test edge cases and error scenarios
