# Task ID: 2
# Title: Develop Context Memory Namespaces
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement hierarchical namespaces for context memory organization with appropriate access controls and query capabilities.
# Details:
Create a namespace system that organizes different types of context data with hierarchical structure. Implement efficient mapping to database structures while preserving backward compatibility. Add support for querying data across multiple namespaces. Create access control mechanisms for namespace-level permissions. Support namespace-specific configuration options. Develop utilities for namespace management (creation, deletion, listing).

# Test Strategy:
Test namespace creation, deletion, and listing. Verify access control mechanisms with different permission levels. Test cross-namespace queries and validate performance. Ensure backward compatibility with existing code through regression tests.
