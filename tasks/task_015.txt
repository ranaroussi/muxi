# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Automatic User Context Extraction System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a MemoryExtractor class and integration system that automatically identifies, evaluates, and stores important user information from conversations to build comprehensive user profiles over time.
# Details:
Implement the automatic user context extraction system as specified in prd-auto-user-context.md with the following components:

1. **MemoryExtractor Class**:
   - Create a class that analyzes conversation text and extracts key user information
   - Implement methods to assign importance scores (1-10) to extracted information
   - Implement confidence scoring (0.0-1.0) for extraction reliability
   - Design storage mechanism to save extracted data to user context memory
   - Support different extraction models with a pluggable architecture

2. **Integration Points**:
   - Integrate with Agent class to process conversations after completion
   - Add hooks in Orchestrator to trigger extraction at appropriate points
   - Ensure extraction runs asynchronously to avoid performance impacts

3. **Configuration System**:
   - Create configuration options for enabling/disabling extraction
   - Add settings for confidence thresholds (default: 0.7)
   - Implement extraction frequency controls
   - Add extraction model selection options

4. **User Filtering**:
   - Skip extraction for anonymous users (user_id=0)
   - Implement whitelist/blacklist functionality for specific users

5. **Extraction Modes**:
   - Implement automatic extraction that runs without explicit calls
   - Create manual extraction API for targeted extraction requests
   - Support batch processing for historical conversations

6. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement tiered extraction models (light/standard/comprehensive)
   - Add caching to prevent redundant extractions
   - Include rate limiting to manage resource usage

7. **Documentation**:
   - Document the extraction patterns and information types
   - Create examples of extracted information formats

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both functionality and performance of the extraction system:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test MemoryExtractor class methods in isolation
   - Verify correct importance and confidence scoring
   - Test extraction with various conversation types
   - Validate anonymous user filtering works correctly

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Verify extraction triggers correctly from Agent and Orchestrator
   - Test configuration changes propagate correctly
   - Ensure extracted data is properly stored in user context

3. **Performance Tests**:
   - Measure extraction time for different conversation lengths
   - Verify asynchronous operation doesn't block main processes
   - Test with high volume to ensure system stability

4. **Accuracy Tests**:
   - Create a dataset of conversations with known information
   - Measure precision and recall of extraction system
   - Test with different confidence thresholds
   - Verify extraction quality across different models

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - Test with extremely long conversations
   - Verify behavior with malformed or unusual text
   - Test with multiple languages
   - Verify system handles conflicting information appropriately

6. **Manual Verification**:
   - Review samples of extracted information for accuracy
   - Compare automatic vs. manual extraction results

## Privacy Control Implementation

```python
class PrivacyManager:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config
        self.sensitive_patterns = self._load_sensitive_patterns()
        self.whitelist = self._load_user_list('whitelist')
        self.blacklist = self._load_user_list('blacklist')
        
    def can_extract_for_user(self, user_id):
        # Skip anonymous users
        if user_id == 0:
            return False
            
        # Check blacklist first (explicit denial)
        if user_id in self.blacklist:
            return False
            
        # If whitelist exists and not empty, user must be in it
        if self.whitelist and user_id not in self.whitelist:
            return False
            
        # Check user consent
        return self._has_user_consent(user_id)
    
    def filter_sensitive_content(self, text):
        # Apply regex patterns to remove sensitive information
        for pattern in self.sensitive_patterns:
            text = re.sub(pattern, '[REDACTED]', text)
        return text
```

## Data Minimization Techniques

2. Semantic summarization - store condensed versions of content
3. Selective field extraction - only store relevant fields
4. PII detection and redaction using NLP models

## Retention Policy Implementation

```python
def apply_retention_policy():
    """Purge data older than retention period"""
    retention_days = config.get('privacy.retention_days', 90)
    cutoff_date = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=retention_days)
    
    db.execute("""
        DELETE FROM user_memories 
        WHERE created_at < %s
    """, (cutoff_date,))
```

## User Consent Management

- Store consent in `user_privacy_settings` table with timestamp
- Implement just-in-time consent prompts in UI
- Provide granular consent options (full extraction, partial, none)
- Track consent changes in audit log

## Data Purge API

```python
@app.route('/api/user/memory/purge', methods=['POST'])
@login_required
def purge_user_memory():
    """Endpoint to purge all extracted memories for current user"""
    user_id = current_user.id
    
    # Log purge request for compliance
    log_data_purge_request(user_id)
    
    # Execute purge
    db.execute("DELETE FROM user_memories WHERE user_id = %s", (user_id,))
    
    return jsonify({"status": "success"})
```
