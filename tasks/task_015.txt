# Task ID: 15
# Title: Optimize Performance of FAISS-Backed Smart Buffer Memory
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance the performance of the recently implemented FAISS-backed smart buffer memory system with hybrid semantic+recency retrieval through profiling and targeted optimizations.
# Details:
The FAISS-backed smart buffer memory system has already replaced the previous deque-based implementation and successfully implements hybrid semantic+recency retrieval with configurable bias parameters. The system includes graceful degradation when memory limits are reached, thread safety mechanisms, and comprehensive documentation in the rules.

This optimization task requires:

1. Profiling the current implementation to identify performance bottlenecks, particularly in:
   - Vector embedding generation
   - FAISS index operations (add, search, delete)
   - Hybrid scoring algorithm combining semantic similarity and recency
   - Thread synchronization mechanisms

2. Implement batch processing for vector operations where applicable to reduce overhead

3. Evaluate and implement index structure optimizations:
   - Test different FAISS index types (Flat, IVF, HNSW) for optimal performance/accuracy tradeoff
   - Tune index parameters based on typical usage patterns
   - Consider quantization techniques to reduce memory footprint

4. Optimize the hybrid scoring algorithm:
   - Pre-compute or cache components where possible
   - Evaluate mathematical simplifications that preserve ranking order

5. Implement memory usage optimizations:
   - Consider selective persistence strategies
   - Evaluate compression techniques for stored vectors
   - Implement smarter pruning strategies based on usage patterns

6. Benchmark improvements against the current implementation using realistic workloads

All optimizations must maintain the existing functionality, thread safety, and graceful degradation capabilities.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both performance improvements and preservation of functionality:

1. Performance Testing:
   - Create benchmark suite with varying memory sizes (small, medium, large)
   - Measure and compare key metrics before and after optimization:
     * Throughput (operations per second)
     * Latency (p50, p95, p99 percentiles)
     * Memory usage
     * CPU utilization
   - Test under different load conditions (light, moderate, heavy)
   - Profile with tools like cProfile or line_profiler to verify bottleneck improvements

2. Functional Testing:
   - Verify retrieval quality remains consistent or improves:
     * Create test dataset with known semantic relationships
     * Compare retrieval results before and after optimization using precision/recall metrics
     * Verify recency bias works as expected with controlled test cases
   - Regression test suite to verify all existing functionality:
     * Thread safety under concurrent operations
     * Graceful degradation when memory limits are reached
     * Correct behavior with edge cases (empty buffer, single item, etc.)

3. Integration Testing:
   - Test in simulated production environment with realistic workloads
   - Verify compatibility with all components that interact with the memory system
   - Measure end-to-end performance improvements in typical usage scenarios

Document all performance improvements with quantitative metrics and include in the final PR.
