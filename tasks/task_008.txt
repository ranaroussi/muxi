# Task ID: 8
# Title: Complete MemoryExtractor Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhance and optimize the existing MemoryExtractor system for automatic user information extraction from conversations.
# Details:
The core MemoryExtractor implementation and integration with Agent and Orchestrator classes is already functional. This task focuses on enhancing and optimizing the existing implementation with the following improvements:

1. Improve entity recognition for various information types
2. Add or refine confidence scoring and conflict resolution for contradictory information
3. Create configurable extraction thresholds and sensitivity controls
4. Implement privacy controls including PII detection and handling
5. Add performance optimizations including tiered model selection
6. Optimize extraction process to further reduce conversation latency impact
7. Extend feature set based on existing implementation

# Test Strategy:
Test extraction accuracy improvements with various conversation types. Verify PII handling compliance with privacy regulations. Benchmark extraction performance to ensure minimal latency impact. Test conflict resolution with contradictory information. Compare performance metrics before and after optimizations to quantify improvements.
