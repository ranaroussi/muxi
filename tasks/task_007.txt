# Task ID: 7
# Title: Enhance Vector Database Support
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize vector operations and add support for additional vector databases with migration tools.
# Details:
Optimize existing vector operations for improved performance. Implement adapters for additional vector databases (Milvus, Qdrant). Create database abstraction layer for consistent API. Develop migration tools for transferring between database types. Implement benchmarking tools for performance comparison. Add support for clustering and sharding configurations. Create guidance documentation for database selection (SQLite vs PostgreSQL).

# Test Strategy:
Benchmark vector operations before and after optimization. Test database adapters with actual database instances. Verify migration tools with sample datasets. Create integration tests for each supported database. Test clustering and sharding configurations.
