# Task ID: 6
# Title: Enhance Vector Database Implementations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add advanced features for scalability and performance to vector database implementations.
# Details:
Add support for clustering and sharding in PostgreSQL. Implement advanced indexing strategies for both database backends. Create database-specific optimizations based on usage patterns. Develop guidance for database selection based on deployment scenarios. Add monitoring and metrics for vector operations. Maintain compatibility with both PostgreSQL and SQLite while ensuring optimizations don't compromise stability.

# Test Strategy:
Test clustering and sharding capabilities with large datasets. Benchmark different indexing strategies. Validate monitoring and metrics accuracy. Ensure compatibility across database versions and configurations.
