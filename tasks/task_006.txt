# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Agent-to-Agent Communication Protocol
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the A2A protocol for inter-agent communication with capability discovery and task delegation.
# Details:
Design and implement the A2A protocol message format. Create capability discovery mechanism for agents to advertise their abilities. Implement task delegation between agents with proper request/response handling. Develop context sharing with isolation boundaries. Create conversation lifecycle management for A2A interactions. Implement authentication and security for A2A communications. Build external agent integration interfaces.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for protocol message handling. Develop integration tests with multiple agents communicating. Test capability discovery with mock agents. Verify task delegation with various scenarios. Test security boundaries and authentication.
