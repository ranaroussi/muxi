# Task ID: 3
# Title: Complete Memory REST API Endpoints
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the remaining REST API endpoints for memory operations as specified in api.md.
# Details:
Complete the implementation of context memory CRUD operations via REST API following RESTful principles. Create endpoints for memory search with filtering and pagination. Add endpoints for memory extraction settings management. Implement bulk operations for memory management. Include proper validation for all endpoints and support both synchronous and streaming responses where appropriate. Document all endpoints with OpenAPI/Swagger.

# Test Strategy:
Create API tests for each endpoint covering success and error cases. Test pagination, filtering, and bulk operations. Verify API documentation accuracy with Swagger UI. Perform load testing to ensure endpoint performance under stress.
