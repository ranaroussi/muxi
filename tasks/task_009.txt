# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Interface-Level User ID Generation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a system for automatic user identification across different interfaces for personalization without explicit login.
# Details:
Implement the UserIdentifier interface and strategies for REST API, WebSocket, and CLI. Create persistent storage for user ID mapping. Develop privacy-preserving fingerprinting techniques. Add middleware for automatic ID injection into request contexts. Implement configuration system for ID generation behavior. Integrate with memory systems for consistent access. Balance uniqueness with privacy in ID generation and support both stateful and stateless operation modes.

# Test Strategy:
Test user identification across different interfaces. Verify persistence of user IDs between sessions. Test privacy-preserving aspects of the implementation. Validate integration with memory systems for personalized experiences.
