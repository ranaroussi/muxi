# Reference

The Reference section provides detailed technical specifications, API documentation, and example code for the MUXI Framework.

## About This Section

This section serves as a comprehensive reference for developers working with MUXI. Here you'll find detailed API documentation, configuration options, package structure information, and practical examples to help you build advanced applications.

## What's In This Section

- [API Documentation](api) - Detailed documentation of all API endpoints
- [Configuration Options](configuration) - Complete reference for configuration parameters
- [Package Structure](package) - Detailed explanation of the package organization
- [Examples Library](examples) - Practical code examples for common use cases
- [Framework Comparisons](comparisons) - How MUXI compares to other AI frameworks

## When to Use This Section

Reference this section when you need:
- Specific details about API endpoints and parameters
- Complete list of configuration options
- Information about the codebase organization
- Practical code examples for specific tasks
- Comparison with other frameworks for evaluation

## How to Use This Section

Unlike the tutorial-style sections of the documentation, the Reference section is designed for looking up specific information. Use the navigation to find the topic you're interested in, or use the search functionality to find specific terms or parameters.

The API Documentation and Configuration Options pages are particularly useful when you need to check the exact parameters for a function or configuration file.

The Examples Library provides practical code snippets that you can adapt for your own projects.
