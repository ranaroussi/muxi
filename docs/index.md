# MUXI - AI Agent Framework

MUXI is an extensible framework for building AI agents with real-time communication capabilities, memory persistence, and tool integration.

{: .warning }
> This project is a work in progress and is not even close to being ready for production use. The framework is actively being developed and new features are being added. Please refer to the [roadmap](roadmap) for detailed information about the current state of the project and where it's headed.

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Create and manage multiple AI agents with different capabilities
- **Standardized LLM Communication**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) for consistent interaction with various LLM providers
- **Memory Systems**: Short-term buffer memory and long-term persistent memory for agents
- **Multi-User Support**: Memobase provides user-specific memory partitioning for multi-tenant applications
- **Tool Integration**: Extensible tool system with built-in utilities and custom tool support
- **Real-Time Communication**: WebSocket support for instant messaging and streaming responses
- **REST API**: Comprehensive API for managing agents, tools, and conversations
- **Command Line Interface**: Rich terminal-based interface for creating and interacting with agents
