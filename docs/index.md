# MUXI - AI Agent Framework

MUXI is an extensible framework for building AI agents with real-time communication capabilities, memory persistence, and tool integration.

{: .warning }
> This project is a work in progress and is not even close to being ready for production use. The framework is actively being developed and new features are being added. Please refer to the [roadmap](roadmap) for detailed information about the current state of the project and where it's headed.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Create and manage multiple AI agents with different capabilities
- **Intelligent Message Routing**: Automatically select the most appropriate agent based on message content
- **Standardized LLM Communication**: Use a consistent protocol across different LLM providers
- **Memory Systems**: Short-term buffer memory and long-term persistent memory
- **Multi-User Support**: Memobase provides user-specific memory partitioning for multi-tenant applications
- **Domain Knowledge**: Store and retrieve structured information to personalize agent responses
- **Tool Integration**: Easy-to-use system for adding capabilities to agents
- **Real-Time Communication**: WebSocket support for instant messaging
- **REST API**: Comprehensive API for managing agents, tools, and conversations
- **Command Line Interface**: Rich terminal-based interface for creating and interacting with agents
- **Flexible Configuration**: Define agents using YAML or JSON with minimal code
