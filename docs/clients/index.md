# Interfaces & Clients

The Interfaces & Clients section covers the different ways to interact with your MUXI agents, from command-line interfaces to web dashboards and WebSocket connections.

## About This Section

MUXI provides multiple interfaces for interacting with your agents, allowing you to choose the best approach for your specific use case. This section explores the different client options, from simple command-line tools to sophisticated web dashboards and real-time WebSocket connections.

## What's In This Section

- [Command-Line Interface](/clients/cli) - Interact with agents through the terminal
- [Server Deployment](/clients/server) - Deploy MUXI as a server for API access
- [Web Dashboard](/clients/web) - Use the visual web interface
- [WebSocket Communication](/clients/websocket) - Implement real-time, streaming communication

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this section, we recommend:
- Completing the [Introduction](/intro/) section
- Understanding how to [build basic agents](/agents/simple)
- Having MUXI installed (see [Installation](/intro/installation))

## Getting Started

If you're looking for a simple way to interact with your agents, start with the [Command-Line Interface](/clients/cli) guide. For deploying MUXI as a service, check out the [Server Deployment](/clients/server) guide.

## Next Steps After Interfaces & Clients

Once you're familiar with the different interfaces, you might want to:
- Explore the [Technical Deep Dives](/technical/) for a deeper understanding of the framework
- Learn about [extending agent capabilities](/extend/) with MCP servers
- Contribute to the project by following the [Development](/development/) guides
