## Planned Features

### Service-Oriented Architecture

Transform the framework into a flexible, distributed system:

- **Client-Server Model**
  - Local and remote operation with the same API
  - Flexible authentication mechanisms
  - Connection management utilities
  - Support for multiple connection profiles

- **Modular Packaging**
  - Core package with minimal dependencies
  - Server package with full capabilities
  - CLI package for remote connections
  - Web package for browser-based access
  - Installation options for different use cases

- **Hybrid Communication Protocol**
  - HTTP for standard API requests
  - SSE (Server-Sent Events) for streaming responses
  - WebSockets for multi-modal and continuous interactions

- **Authentication Implementation**
  - API key authentication
  - Auto-generated keys with one-time display
  - Environment variable configuration
  - Explicit auth configuration options

- **MCP Server Unification**
  - Tool system based on MCP servers
  - Adapters for local Python tools
  - Service discovery mechanisms
  - Deployment utilities

### Multi-Modal Agent Capabilities

Transform agents into omni agents capable of handling various media types:

  - Support for image attachments in messages
  - Integration with vision-capable models (GPT-4V, Claude 3, Gemini)
  - Image preprocessing and optimization

- Audio processing
  - Audio file handling and transcription
  - Streaming audio input/output capabilities
  - Real-time speech-to-text and text-to-speech
  - Support for voice conversations with agents

- Document processing
