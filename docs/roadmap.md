# MUXI Framework Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for the MUXI Framework, including completed releases, current development status, and planned future enhancements. The roadmap is organized by version milestones and development phases.

## Overview

The MUXI Framework is being developed in a phased approach, with each phase building upon the previous one to create a comprehensive framework for AI agent development. Our development philosophy emphasizes:

1. **Solid Foundations**: Building reliable core components before adding advanced features
2. **API-First Design**: Designing with API compatibility and extensibility in mind
3. **Modular Architecture**: Creating clean, loosely-coupled subsystems
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Adding capabilities iteratively based on user feedback

## Development Phases

Our overall development is structured into distinct phases:

### Phase 1: Core Framework (v0.1.0 - v0.3.0) ‚úÖ

This phase established the foundational architecture and core components of the framework:

- Basic agent functionality with LLM integration
- Memory systems (buffer and long-term)
- MCP client integration for external tools
- Multi-agent support with orchestration
- Configuration system
- Basic CLI interface
- Basic REST API foundations

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (v0.4.0) üõ†Ô∏è

This phase focuses on enhancing the framework with advanced communication capabilities:

- Full-featured CLI interface
- Complete REST API implementation
- Complete WebSocket API implementation
- Basic MCP server interface implementation
- Initial Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocol
- Additional LLM providers
