# Development Roadmap

This document outlines the high-level strategic vision and planned future development of the muxi framework. For detailed developer tasks and implementation checkboxes, see the `NEXT_STEPS` file in the project root.

## Short-term Goals

- Complete core agent functionality ✅
- Implement basic memory systems ✅
- Add essential built-in tools ✅
- Finalize REST API specification ✅
- Implement WebSocket communication ✅
- Add user-specific domain knowledge support ✅

## Medium-term Goals

- Enhance LLM provider support
- Improve agent orchestration capabilities ✅
- Add advanced memory persistence ✅
- Develop more sophisticated built-in tools
- Create comprehensive documentation

## Long-term Vision

- Support multi-modal agents
- Implement distributed orchestration
- Create an agent marketplace
- Build advanced analytics and monitoring
- Develop managed SaaS offering

## Planned Features

### Docker Distribution

Develop a comprehensive Docker image strategy:

- Create a base image with core framework functionality
- Bundle popular community-provided MCP servers
- Implement a plugin architecture for easy MCP server addition
- Support layered customization options:
  - Use base image as-is with common MCP servers
  - Extend the image with additional MCP servers
  - Mount custom MCP server code at runtime
  - Build custom images from the base
- Provide clear documentation for customization
- Establish a community contribution process for MCP servers
- Consider maintaining a registry of verified MCP servers

### Memory System Enhancements

- Implement vector database integration ✅
- Add support for structured knowledge storage ✅
- Add support for user-specific domain knowledge ✅
- Implement robust database schema with optimized indexes ✅
- Create migration system for schema version control ✅
- Develop memory pruning/summarization
- Create memory visualization tools

### Tool Ecosystem

- Implement base tool interface ✅
- Create tool registry for managing tools ✅
- Add example tools (Calculator, Web Search) ✅
- Develop a tool marketplace
- Implement tool versioning
- Create a tool testing framework
- Standardize tool documentation

### UI/UX Improvements

- CLI interface with rich terminal-based interaction ✅
- Initial web dashboard ✅
