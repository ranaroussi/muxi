# MUXI Framework Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for the MUXI Framework, including completed releases, current development status, and planned future enhancements. The roadmap is organized by version milestones and development phases.

## Overview

The MUXI Framework is being developed in a phased approach, with each phase building upon the previous one to create a comprehensive framework for AI agent development. Our development philosophy emphasizes:

1. **Solid Foundations**: Building reliable core components before adding advanced features
2. **API-First Design**: Designing with API compatibility and extensibility in mind
3. **Modular Architecture**: Creating clean, loosely-coupled subsystems
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Adding capabilities iteratively based on user feedback

## Development Phases

Our overall development is structured into distinct phases:

### Phase 1: Core Framework (v0.1.0 - v0.3.0) ✅

This phase established the foundational architecture and core components of the framework:

- Basic agent functionality with LLM integration
- Memory systems (buffer and long-term)
- MCP client integration for external tools
- Multi-agent support with orchestration
- Configuration system
- Basic CLI interface
- Basic REST API foundations

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (v0.4.0) 🛠️

This phase focuses on enhancing the framework with advanced communication capabilities:

- Complete REST API implementation
- Complete WebSocket API implementation
- Enhanced CLI interface
- Web UI development
- Basic MCP server interface implementation
- Initial Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocol
- Additional LLM providers
- Enhanced documentation
- Basic multi-modal support

### Phase 3: Scaling & Monitoring (v0.5.0) 📅

This phase will prepare the framework for production deployment at scale:

- Advanced A2A communication with capability discovery
- Vector database optimizations and additional integrations
- Full MCP Server interface with streaming response support
- Comprehensive testing and documentation
- Deployment solutions and containerization
- Language-specific SDKs
- Full multi-modal support
- Performance monitoring and metrics

### Memory System Enhancements
- **Enhanced Context Memory**: Add support for templates, improved merging, and namespaces.
- **Automatic User Information Extraction**: Implement the system for automatically extracting and storing important user information from conversations.
- **Memory Optimization**: Improve performance and reduce resource usage of vector operations.

> **Note**: Based on performance benchmarks showing PostgreSQL with pgvector achieving 471.57 QPS and lower latency compared to alternatives, additional vector database integrations (Milvus, Qdrant, Weaviate) have been deprioritized. We'll reconsider these integrations if community demand emerges.

...

### Phase 10: Enterprise Ready (v1.0.0) 🔮

This phase will complete the framework's feature set for enterprise use:

- Comprehensive security features
- Advanced deployment options
- Extended LLM provider support
- Full production readiness
- Complete documentation and examples
- Stable, backward-compatible API
