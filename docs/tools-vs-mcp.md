# Tools versus MCP Servers

This document outlines the key differences, trade-offs, and use cases for using internal Tools versus external MCP Servers in the MUXI Framework.

## Key Concepts

### Internal Tools
Internal tools are native implementations within the framework that provide specific capabilities to agents. They are:
- Directly integrated into the framework codebase
- Called as internal functions
- Managed by the framework's tool registry

### MCP Servers
MCP (Model Context Protocol) Servers are external services that expose capabilities via a standardized API. They:
- Run as separate services (potentially on different machines)
- Communicate via HTTP/WebSocket
- Follow the MCP specification for request/response formats
- Can be used by multiple different AI systems that support the MCP protocol

## Architectural Differences

| Aspect | Internal Tools | MCP Servers |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Integration | Direct code integration | Network API calls |
| Hosting | Within framework process | Separate service |
| Communication | Function calls | HTTP/WebSocket |
| Deployment | Part of main application | Independent deployment |
| Reusability | Framework-specific | Cross-platform |
| Extension | Requires code changes | Plug-and-play |

## Performance Considerations

Internal tools generally offer better performance due to:
- No network latency
- No HTTP request/response overhead
- No serialization/deserialization costs
- Direct function calls without protocol overhead
- No authentication handshakes
- Shared memory access

MCP servers may introduce performance overhead, particularly noticeable in:
- High-frequency tool calls
- Tools that process large data volumes
- Low-latency requirements
- Tools with quick execution times (where network overhead becomes the dominant cost)

However, the performance difference may be negligible when:
- The tool's actual execution time is long (e.g., complex analysis)
- Call frequency is low
- The MCP server is hosted very close to your application

## Use Case Recommendations

### When to Use Internal Tools
- Performance-critical operations
- Core functionality that rarely changes
- Proprietary capabilities specific to your use case
- Tightly coupled with framework internals
- Simple utilities with minimal dependencies

### When to Use MCP Servers
- Widely used capabilities (GitHub, web search, etc.)
- Functionality that may be shared across multiple AI systems
- When offering a SaaS where customers need to extend functionality
- Complex tools with many dependencies
- Tools that require regular updates
- When security isolation is important

## Implementation Strategy

A balanced approach would be:
1. Implement core, performance-sensitive functionality as internal tools
2. Use MCP servers for:
   - Common, standardized capabilities
   - Customer extension points
   - Complex tools with many dependencies
   - Tools that might be reused across different AI systems

## SaaS Considerations

When offering this framework as a SaaS:
- Internal tools provide the core capabilities
- MCP servers provide the extension mechanism for customers
- Customers can develop their own MCP servers without needing access to your codebase
- You can maintain a marketplace or registry of third-party MCP servers

## Real-World Examples

| Capability | Internal Tool Approach | MCP Server Approach |
|------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| File operations | Direct filesystem access | File management MCP server |
| Web search | API client in codebase | External search MCP server |
| GitHub PR review | GitHub API client | GitHub integration MCP server |
| Code generation | Direct LLM calls | Specialized coding MCP server |
| Database queries | Direct DB connections | Data access MCP server |

## Conclusion

Both approaches have their place in a well-designed AI agent system. The key is choosing the right approach for each specific capability based on performance needs, reusability requirements, and extension patterns.

For a production system, a hybrid approach leveraging the strengths of both patterns will likely yield the best results.

## Creating Custom MCP Servers

The MUXI framework provides a built-in utility to help you create custom MCP servers quickly:

```bash
# Generate a new MCP server interactively
muxi create mcp-server
```

This command launches an interactive wizard that guides you through:
1. Naming your MCP server
2. Adding a description
3. Defining custom tools
4. Generating all necessary code

### Benefits of the Generator

The MCP server generator:
- Creates the proper file structure for an MCP server
- Sets up FastAPI endpoints following the MCP specification
- Generates tool template classes ready to be implemented
- Creates a README with usage instructions
- Configures installation files (setup.py)
- Provides example client code

### Customizing Generated Servers

Once generated, you can implement your tool logic by editing the tool files in the `tools/` directory. Each tool includes a template with:
- Proper class inheritance
- Method signatures
- Documentation placeholders
- Example return values

For example, a generated tool might look like:

```python
class WeatherTool(BaseTool):
    """
    Get weather information for a location.
    """

    name = "weather"
    description = "Get weather information for a location"

    def execute(self, location: str, units: str = "metric") -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """
        Execute the weather tool.

        Args:
            location: The location to get weather for
            units: The units to use (metric or imperial)

        Returns:
            Dict[str, Any]: The weather information
        """
        # TODO: Implement your weather API call here

        return {"result": f"Weather information for {location}"}
```

The generator significantly reduces the boilerplate needed to create MCP servers, making it easier to build and share custom capabilities.
