# Agents & Models

This section provides technical deep dives into the agent architecture and language model integration within the MUXI Framework.

## About This Section

The Agents & Models subsystem is the core of the MUXI Framework. This section explores the technical details of agent implementation, language model integration, multi-modal support, and orchestration mechanics.

## What's In This Section

- [Agent Fundamentals](fundamentals) - Core agent architecture and implementation
- [Language Models](models) - Model integration and provider interfaces
- [Multi-Modal Support](multi-modal) - Handling images, audio, and other modalities
- [Orchestration](orchestration) - Multi-agent coordination and message routing

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this section, we recommend:
- Understanding the basics of [building agents](../../agents/simple)
- Familiarity with language models like GPT-4, Claude, etc.
- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Understanding of prompt engineering concepts

## Implementation Details

The agent system includes several key technical features:
- Agent lifecycle management
- Message handling and processing
- Memory integration
- Tool and function calling
- Model provider abstraction
- Multi-agent orchestration
