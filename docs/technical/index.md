# Technical Deep Dives

The Technical Deep Dives section provides detailed, technical explanations of the MUXI Framework's components and subsystems.

## About This Section

This section is intended for developers who want to understand the internal workings of MUXI or who want to extend or modify the framework itself. Here you'll find in-depth explanations of the core components, detailed architecture diagrams, and technical discussions of implementation choices.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this section, we recommend:
- Completing the [Introduction](/intro/) section
- Having experience building and using MUXI agents
- Familiarity with advanced Python concepts
- Understanding of LLM and AI agent architectures

## Getting Started

The subsections can be read in any order depending on your interests. If you're looking to understand how agents work internally, start with [Agent Fundamentals](/technical/agents/fundamentals). If you're interested in memory systems, check out [Buffer Memory](/technical/memory/buffer) first.

## Next Steps After Technical Deep Dives

After exploring the technical details, you might want to:
- Contribute to the project by following the [Development](/development/) guides
- Reference the [API Documentation](/reference/api) for detailed interface specifications
- Explore [advanced examples](/reference/examples) that demonstrate sophisticated use cases
