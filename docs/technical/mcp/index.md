# MCP System

This section provides technical deep dives into the Model Context Protocol (MCP) system of the MUXI Framework.

## About This Section

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is the standardized communication layer that enables agents to access external services and functionality. This section explores the technical details of the MCP system, how to create MCP servers, and best practices for security.

## What's In This Section

- [MCP Fundamentals](fundamentals) - The core concepts and architecture of the MCP system
- [Creating MCP Servers](creating-servers) - Technical details for building custom MCP servers
- [Security Considerations](security) - Best practices for secure MCP server implementation

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this section, we recommend:
- Understanding the basics of [using MCP servers](../../extend/using-mcp)
- Familiarity with RESTful API design
- Knowledge of web server frameworks like FastAPI or Flask
- Understanding of JSON request/response formats

## Implementation Details

The MCP system includes several key technical features:
- Standardized request/response format
- Function calling and parameter serialization
- Result parsing and error handling
- Authentication and security mechanisms
- Service discovery and registration
