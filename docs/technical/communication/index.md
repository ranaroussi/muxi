# Communication

This section provides technical deep dives into the communication systems of the MUXI Framework.

## About This Section

The communication layer is how users and applications interact with the MUXI Framework. This section explores the technical details of the various communication interfaces, including the REST API, WebSocket interface, command-line interface, and web UI.

## What's In This Section

- [REST API](rest-api) - The HTTP API for interacting with MUXI
- [WebSocket Interface](websocket) - Real-time, bi-directional communication
- [CLI](cli) - Command-line interface implementation details
- [Web UI](web-ui) - Web dashboard architecture and implementation

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this section, we recommend:
- Understanding the basics of [interfaces and clients](../../clients/)
- Familiarity with HTTP, REST, and WebSocket protocols
- Knowledge of authentication and security practices
- Experience with client-server architectures

## Implementation Details

The communication system includes several key technical features:
- JSON-based API for standardized communication
- WebSocket streaming for real-time updates
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) for one-way streaming
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) support
- Error handling and status codes
