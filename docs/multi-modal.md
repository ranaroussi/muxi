# Multi-Modal Capabilities (Coming Soon)

The MUXI Framework is expanding to support multi-modal agents capable of processing and generating content across different modalities, including text, images, audio, documents, and eventually video.

## Overview

Multi-modal agents can understand and interact with various types of media, providing a more natural and rich interaction experience. This allows agents to:

- Process images and understand their content
- Handle audio for speech recognition and synthesis
- Work with documents like PDFs and Office files
- Stream real-time audio for voice conversations
- (Eventually) Process video content

## Architecture

The multi-modal capabilities are being built as an extension to the existing framework, with these key components:

### Enhanced Message Structure

The `MCPMessage` class will be extended to support media attachments:

```python
class MCPMessage:
    def __init__(
        self,
        role: str,
        content: str,
        name: Optional[str] = None,
        attachments: List[Dict[str, Any]] = None,
        metadata: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
    ):
        self.role = role
        self.content = content
        self.name = name
        self.attachments = attachments or []
        self.metadata = metadata or {}
```

Each attachment will include metadata about the media type, format, and content.

### Media Processing Pipeline

A dedicated media processing module will handle different media types:

```python
class MediaProcessor:
    def process_image(self, image_data, target_size=None, format="jpeg"):
        """Process image data for model consumption"""

    def process_audio(self, audio_data, target_format="mp3", max_duration=None):
        """Process audio data"""

    def process_video(self, video_data, extract_frames=False, max_duration=None):
        """Process video data"""

    def encode_for_model(self, media_data, media_type, model_provider):
        """Encode media in the format expected by the specific LLM provider"""
```

### Media Storage System

A storage system will manage media files efficiently:

```python
class MediaStorage:
    def store(self, media_data, media_type, file_name=None):
        """Store media data and return a reference"""

    def retrieve(self, media_reference):
        """Retrieve media data from storage"""

    def cleanup(self, older_than=None):
        """Clean up old media files"""
```

### Streaming Media Support

For real-time audio and video interactions:

- WebSocket extensions for streaming media
- Buffer management for smooth playback
- WebRTC integration for voice/video chat
- Session management for maintaining connections

## Supported Media Types

### Images

- Support for common formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
- Integration with vision models (GPT-4V, Claude 3, Gemini)
- Preprocessing for optimization (resizing, format conversion)

### Audio

- Support for audio files (MP3, WAV, OGG, etc.)
- Real-time streaming for voice conversations
- Speech-to-text using OpenAI Whisper and other providers
- Text-to-speech for natural voice responses

### Documents

- PDF processing and text extraction
- Support for Office documents (Word, Excel, PowerPoint)
- OCR for scanned documents
- Document summarization

### Video (Future)

- Video file processing
- Frame extraction and analysis
- Real-time video streaming
- Video content understanding

## Implementation Roadmap

1. Image support (Phase 1)
2. Audio file support (Phase 1)
3. Document processing (Phase 2)
4. Streaming audio capabilities (Phase 2)
5. Video support (Phase 3)

## API Extensions

The API will be extended to support media:

```python
# File upload endpoint
@app.post("/chat/{agent_id}/with_media")
async def chat_with_media(
    agent_id: str,
    message: str = Form(...),
    files: List[UploadFile] = File(None),
    user_id: Optional[str] = None
)

# WebSocket support for streaming media
async def handle_audio_stream(ws, data):
    # Real-time audio streaming implementation
```

## WebSocket Protocol Extensions

New message types for WebSocket communication:

```json
// Send an image
{
  "type": "media_upload",
  "media_type": "image",
  "data": "base64_encoded_image",
  "file_name": "photo.jpg"
}

// Start audio streaming
{
  "type": "start_audio_stream",
  "format": "mp3",
  "sample_rate": 44100
}

// Audio chunk in streaming session
{
  "type": "audio_chunk",
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "data": "base64_encoded_audio_chunk",
  "timestamp": 1684321067
}
```

## Usage Examples

Once implemented, multi-modal capabilities will enable rich interactions:

```python
from src import muxi

# Initialize with multi-modal support
mx = muxi()
mx.add_agent("assistant", "configs/vision_assistant.yaml")

# Upload an image with a question
with open("image.jpg", "rb") as img_file:
    response = mx.chat_with_media(
        "What's in this image?",
        attachments=[{
            "type": "image",
            "data": img_file.read(),
            "file_name": "image.jpg"
        }],
        agent_name="assistant"
    )

print(response)  # The agent describes the image content
```

Stay tuned for updates as we implement these exciting capabilities!
