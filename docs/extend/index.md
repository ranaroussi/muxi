# Extending Capabilities

{: .fs-5 .fw-600 }
The Extending Capabilities section covers ways to enhance your agents with external services, domain knowledge, and advanced features.

By connecting agents to external servers, integrating specialized knowledge, and supporting multi-modal interactions, you can create more powerful and versatile agents.

## About This Section

While basic agents are powerful on their own, MUXI really shines when you extend their capabilities. This section explores how to connect agents to external services through MCP servers, integrate domain-specific knowledge, and support multi-modal interactions.

## What's In This Section

- [Using MCP Servers](../extend/mcp) - Connect your agents to existing MCP servers
- [Domain Knowledge Integration](../extend/knowledge) - Add specialized knowledge to your agents
- [Multi-Modal Support](../extend/multi-modal) - Work with images, audio, and other non-text formats

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this section, we recommend:
- Completing the [Introduction](../intro/) section
- Understanding how to [build basic agents](../agents/simple)
- Familiarity with the [MCP system](../technical/mcp/fundamentals) (for creating custom servers)

## Next Steps After Extending Capabilities

Once you've extended your agents' capabilities, you might want to:
- Build [multi-agent systems](../agents/multi-agent) that combine different capabilities
- Explore [client interfaces](../clients/) to interact with your enhanced agents
- Learn about [advanced memory techniques](../technical/memory/buffer) to improve contextual understanding
