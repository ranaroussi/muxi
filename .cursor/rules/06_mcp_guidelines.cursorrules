# MUXI Framework - MCP (Modern Control Protocol) Guidelines

> These rules define best practices for MCP implementation

## Message Format
- Follow the official MCP specification for message formats
- Properly serialize and deserialize MCP messages
- Include required fields in all messages
- Use consistent naming conventions for custom message types
- Validate message format before processing
- Handle malformed messages gracefully
- Implement proper error responses
- Use appropriate content types
- Include message IDs for tracking and correlation
- Properly handle different versions of the protocol
- Support streaming responses when appropriate
- Document any extensions to the standard protocol

## Tool Calls
- Implement proper tool call handling
- Register tools with unique identifiers
- Include detailed tool descriptions
- Handle tool execution errors gracefully
- Return standardized tool results
- Include execution metadata in responses
- Implement timeout handling for long-running tool calls
- Support parallel tool execution when appropriate
- Properly handle tool authentication and authorization
- Log all tool calls for debugging and audit
- Include rate limiting for resource-intensive tools
- Implement proper error messages for tool failures

## LLM Integration
- Properly format messages for different LLM providers
- Handle provider-specific extensions
- Implement fallback mechanisms for provider outages
- Properly handle streaming responses
- Process tool call requests from LLMs
- Format tool results for LLM consumption
- Handle context limitations appropriately
- Implement appropriate retry logic
- Monitor token usage and implement limits
- Handle provider rate limits gracefully
- Process and validate LLM responses
- Support different model capabilities

## Security
- Validate all inputs
- Implement proper authentication for tool access
- Limit tool capabilities based on user permissions
- Sanitize tool inputs and outputs
- Implement proper error handling that doesn't leak information
- Log security-relevant events
- Handle sensitive information appropriately
- Implement timeouts for all external calls

- Implement proper access control for different tools
- Monitor for abuse patterns

## External MCP Servers
- Implement proper connection management
- Handle reconnection automatically

## Testing
- Test happy path scenarios for all tools
- Test error conditions and failures
- Implement integration tests with actual LLM providers
- Test with mock LLMs for predictable results
- Validate message formats
- Test timeout and cancellation handling
- Test authentication and authorization
- Include MCP tests in CI/CD pipeline
- Test rate limiting
- Implement contract testing
- Test with different LLM providers
- Use representative test data

## Docker Integration
- Package MCP servers in containerized environments
- Use consistent port mapping for MCP servers
- Implement proper health checks
