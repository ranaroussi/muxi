# MUXI Framework - API Design Guidelines

> These rules define best practices for API design and documentation

## RESTful API Design
- Use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Return proper status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, 500, etc.)
- Implement consistent URL structure (/resources/{id}/subresources)
- Version APIs appropriately (v1, v2, etc.)
- Use pagination for large collections
- Implement filtering, sorting, and search capabilities
- Use query parameters for filtering and pagination
- Use consistent naming conventions for endpoints
- Return meaningful error responses with details
- Implement proper rate limiting
- Support CORS for browser clients
- Use consistent date/time formats (ISO 8601)
- Implement proper content negotiation
- Use HTTPS for all API endpoints

## API Serialization
- Use JSON as the primary serialization format
- Maintain consistent naming convention (snake_case or camelCase)
- Include proper metadata in responses (pagination info, etc.)
- Use nested objects sparingly to avoid deep nesting
- Include a top-level status or success field for all responses
- Implement envelope-style response for consistent error handling
- Use consistent date/time formats (ISO 8601)
- Handle null values consistently
- Include resource IDs in response bodies
- Use meaningful field names that reflect their purpose
- Support field selection (partial responses) where appropriate
- Implement consistent serialization/deserialization

## WebSocket Standards
- Define clear message types
- Implement proper connection management
- Handle reconnection gracefully
- Document message formats
- Include appropriate error handling
- Use a consistent message envelope format
- Implement heartbeat mechanism
- Handle connection timeouts
- Support authentication
- Document connection lifecycle
- Implement proper error codes
- Support binary message formats when needed
- Implement message ordering and acknowledgment when required

## API Documentation
- Document all endpoints with OpenAPI/Swagger
- Include example requests and responses
- Document error conditions and responses
- Keep documentation in sync with code
- Generate client SDKs from specification
- Include authentication requirements
- Document rate limits
- Add pagination examples
- Include versioning information
- Provide getting started guide
- Document security considerations
- Include API changelog
- Add search functionality to documentation
- Provide sandbox environment for testing
- Include code examples in multiple languages

## API Security
- Implement proper authentication (JWT, OAuth, etc.)
- Use HTTPS for all API endpoints
- Implement proper authorization for resources
- Validate all inputs
- Implement proper rate limiting
- Use secure HTTP headers
- Handle PII data securely
- Implement CORS properly
- Log security-relevant events
- Use appropriate token expiration
- Implement proper error handling that doesn't leak information
- Perform security audits regularly
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Follow OWASP API security guidelines

## API Testing
- Test happy path scenarios
- Test error conditions
- Test edge cases
- Implement integration tests
- Test performance under load
- Automate API tests
- Test with various client libraries
- Validate response schemas
- Test authentication and authorization
- Include API tests in CI/CD pipeline
- Test rate limiting
- Implement contract testing
- Test backward compatibility for updated endpoints
- Use meaningful test data
