# MCP Integration Notes

## Summary
We've successfully integrated the Model Context Protocol (MCP) Python SDK into the MUXI framework. This document outlines the challenges we faced and the solutions we implemented.

## Updates (Latest Progress)

1. **Package Availability**:
   - The MCP Python SDK is now available on PyPI as `mcp>=1.4.1`
   - Updated requirements.txt to use the PyPI version
   - No longer need to install from GitHub

2. **Successful Connection**:
   - Successfully connected to mcpify.ai MCP server using HTTP+SSE transport
   - Implemented reference solution in `tests/mcp_updated_transport.py`
   - Identified proper connection flow and header requirements

3. **Connection Flow**:
   - Initial SSE connection to the `/sse` endpoint with proper headers
   - Server provides message endpoint URL with session ID via an SSE event
   - JSON-RPC requests sent as POST to the provided endpoint URL
   - Asynchronous responses come through the SSE stream

## Initial Challenges

1. **Import Structure**:
   - The MCP SDK has a different module structure than expected
   - The main client is available at `mcp.client.session.ClientSession`
   - JSON-RPC components are available directly from the `mcp` module (e.g., `mcp.JSONRPCRequest`)
   - There's no direct equivalent to `modelcontextprotocol.transport` in the SDK

2. **Transport Implementation**:
   - The SDK doesn't provide direct HTTP+SSE and command-line transports
   - We implemented custom transport classes for these transport methods
   - Successfully created a working HTTP+SSE implementation

## Key Insights

1. **URL Construction**:
   - The message URL is provided fully formed by the server, including session ID
   - Do not construct this URL manually - use exactly what the server provides

2. **Asynchronous Nature**:
   - The MCP server follows a fully asynchronous model
   - Requests receive 202 Accepted status codes
   - Actual responses come through the SSE stream
   - This requires maintaining an active SSE connection

3. **Headers Matter**:
   - Proper SSE headers are required for stable connections:
     ```
     Accept: text/event-stream
     Cache-Control: no-cache
     Connection: keep-alive
     ```

4. **Timeout Handling**:
   - Longer timeouts needed for SSE connections (60s vs standard 30s)

## Solutions

1. **Reference Implementation**:
   - Created a working reference in `tests/mcp_updated_transport.py`
   - Successfully connects to mcpify.ai server
   - Extracts message endpoint URL and session ID
   - Sends JSON-RPC requests and receives 202 Accepted responses

2. **Documentation**:
   - Created integration guide in `mcp-integration-guide.md`
   - Updated progress documentation in `mcp-progress.md`
   - Documented migration from GitHub to PyPI in `mcp-pypi-migration.md`

## Next Steps

1. **Code Integration**:
   - Update the main `HTTPSSETransport` implementation with our working code
   - Ensure all import statements throughout the codebase are updated
   - Test the integrated implementation with the mcpify.ai server

2. **Event Handling**:
   - Implement proper SSE event handling to process responses
   - Add request tracking to match responses with pending requests
   - Create background tasks for event listening

3. **Error Handling and Resilience**:
   - Improve error handling for connection failures
   - Add reconnection logic with exponential backoff
   - Implement proper request timeouts

4. **Testing**:
   - Create comprehensive tests for the updated implementation
   - Test with various MCP servers
   - Ensure compatibility with the MCP specification

# MCP HTTP+SSE Transport Implementation Notes

## Summary

We've implemented HTTP+SSE transport for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) in the MUXI framework, encountering several challenges that provide valuable insights for future work.

## Key Findings

1. **SDK Evolution:** The MCP Python SDK has evolved considerably, with changes in how it expects to interact with transports. The current version uses `anyio` memory streams for communication rather than a direct transport interface.

2. **Connection Challenges:** Our attempts to connect to the MCP server resulted in HTTP 405 "Method Not Allowed" errors, suggesting:
   - The URL format or endpoints we're using don't match the server's API
   - The HTTP methods we're using aren't supported by the server
   - Potential authentication or header requirements we're missing

3. **SSE Implementation:** The Server-Sent Events (SSE) portion of the transport requires careful handling of connection establishment, event listening, and session management.

## Implementation Approach

Our implementation evolved through several iterations:

1. **Initial Approach:** Direct transport implementation with HTTP POST for sending requests and SSE for listening to events.

2. **Intermediate Approach:** Adapting to use memory streams with the MCPClient, using a bridging mechanism between the streams and our HTTP transport.

3. **Simplified Testing:** Direct HTTP requests to test basic connectivity without the complexity of memory streams and SSE event handling.

## Code Structure

The HTTP+SSE transport implementation is structured as follows:

1. **HTTPSSETransport:** Handles the core transport functionality
   - Connection management
   - Request sending
   - Response handling
   - SSE event listening

2. **MCPServerClient:** Manages a connection to a specific MCP server
   - Creates and manages memory streams
   - Bridges between MCP SDK and our transport
   - Handles credential management

3. **MCPHandler:** Provides a high-level API for the agent
   - Server connection management
   - Message processing
   - Tool execution

## Current Status

The implementation is functional but requires further work to properly connect to MCP servers. The main issues are:

1. **Server Connectivity:** We need to resolve the HTTP 405 errors by ensuring our endpoint paths and methods match the server's expectations.

2. **Memory Stream Integration:** The bridging between memory streams and HTTP transport needs additional testing and refinement.

3. **Error Handling:** More robust error handling and reconnection logic is needed.

## Next Steps

1. **Server Documentation:** Research the correct URL format, endpoints, and methods for MCP servers.

2. **Test Infrastructure:** Set up a local MCP server for testing or identify a public test server.

3. **Refine Implementation:** Update the transport based on findings from server documentation and testing.

4. **Documentation:** Create comprehensive documentation for the transport implementation.

## Conclusion

The HTTP+SSE transport implementation for MCP represents a significant step toward integrating the MUXI framework with MCP servers. While challenges remain in establishing proper connectivity, the core architecture is in place and ready for refinement once server requirements are clarified.
