# MCP Integration Notes

## Summary
We've been working on integrating the Model Context Protocol (MCP) Python SDK into the MUXI framework. This document outlines the challenges we faced and the solutions we implemented.

## Challenges

1. **Package Availability**:
   - The MCP Python SDK is not yet available on PyPI
   - We installed it directly from GitHub: `pip install git+https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk.git`
   - Updated requirements.txt to reference the GitHub repository

2. **Import Structure**:
   - The MCP SDK has a different module structure than expected
   - The main client is available at `mcp.client.session.ClientSession`
   - JSON-RPC components are available directly from the `mcp` module (e.g., `mcp.JSONRPCRequest`)
   - There's no direct equivalent to `modelcontextprotocol.transport` in the SDK

3. **Transport Implementation**:
   - The SDK doesn't provide direct HTTP+SSE and command-line transports
   - We implemented placeholder classes for these transports
   - Future work should involve properly implementing these transport mechanisms

## Solutions

1. **Import Paths**:
   - Updated import statements in `mcp_handler.py` to match the actual SDK structure
   - Created placeholder classes for missing functionality

2. **Testing Approach**:
   - Created a simplified test that just verifies the handler can be instantiated
   - Future tests should be written with the actual SDK structure in mind

3. **Documentation**:
   - Added notes to the codebase explaining the SDK structure
   - Updated requirements.txt with information about the SDK version

## Next Steps

1. Implement proper transport classes for HTTP+SSE and command-line
2. Expand test coverage for the MCPHandler class
3. Update the Agent class to interact correctly with the MCPHandler
4. Document the MCP integration in the project documentation

# MCP HTTP+SSE Transport Implementation Notes

## Summary

We've implemented HTTP+SSE transport for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) in the MUXI framework, encountering several challenges that provide valuable insights for future work.

## Key Findings

1. **SDK Evolution:** The MCP Python SDK has evolved considerably, with changes in how it expects to interact with transports. The current version uses `anyio` memory streams for communication rather than a direct transport interface.

2. **Connection Challenges:** Our attempts to connect to the MCP server resulted in HTTP 405 "Method Not Allowed" errors, suggesting:
   - The URL format or endpoints we're using don't match the server's API
   - The HTTP methods we're using aren't supported by the server
   - Potential authentication or header requirements we're missing

3. **SSE Implementation:** The Server-Sent Events (SSE) portion of the transport requires careful handling of connection establishment, event listening, and session management.

## Implementation Approach

Our implementation evolved through several iterations:

1. **Initial Approach:** Direct transport implementation with HTTP POST for sending requests and SSE for listening to events.

2. **Intermediate Approach:** Adapting to use memory streams with the MCPClient, using a bridging mechanism between the streams and our HTTP transport.

3. **Simplified Testing:** Direct HTTP requests to test basic connectivity without the complexity of memory streams and SSE event handling.

## Code Structure

The HTTP+SSE transport implementation is structured as follows:

1. **HTTPSSETransport:** Handles the core transport functionality
   - Connection management
   - Request sending
   - Response handling
   - SSE event listening

2. **MCPServerClient:** Manages a connection to a specific MCP server
   - Creates and manages memory streams
   - Bridges between MCP SDK and our transport
   - Handles credential management

3. **MCPHandler:** Provides a high-level API for the agent
   - Server connection management
   - Message processing
   - Tool execution

## Current Status

The implementation is functional but requires further work to properly connect to MCP servers. The main issues are:

1. **Server Connectivity:** We need to resolve the HTTP 405 errors by ensuring our endpoint paths and methods match the server's expectations.

2. **Memory Stream Integration:** The bridging between memory streams and HTTP transport needs additional testing and refinement.

3. **Error Handling:** More robust error handling and reconnection logic is needed.

## Next Steps

1. **Server Documentation:** Research the correct URL format, endpoints, and methods for MCP servers.

2. **Test Infrastructure:** Set up a local MCP server for testing or identify a public test server.

3. **Refine Implementation:** Update the transport based on findings from server documentation and testing.

4. **Documentation:** Create comprehensive documentation for the transport implementation.

## Conclusion

The HTTP+SSE transport implementation for MCP represents a significant step toward integrating the MUXI framework with MCP servers. While challenges remain in establishing proper connectivity, the core architecture is in place and ready for refinement once server requirements are clarified.
