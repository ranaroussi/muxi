# MCP Integration Notes

## Summary
We've been working on integrating the Model Context Protocol (MCP) Python SDK into the MUXI framework. This document outlines the challenges we faced and the solutions we implemented.

## Challenges

1. **Package Availability**:
   - The MCP Python SDK is not yet available on PyPI
   - We installed it directly from GitHub: `pip install git+https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk.git`
   - Updated requirements.txt to reference the GitHub repository

2. **Import Structure**:
   - The MCP SDK has a different module structure than expected
   - The main client is available at `mcp.client.session.ClientSession`
   - JSON-RPC components are available directly from the `mcp` module (e.g., `mcp.JSONRPCRequest`)
   - There's no direct equivalent to `modelcontextprotocol.transport` in the SDK

3. **Transport Implementation**:
   - The SDK doesn't provide direct HTTP+SSE and command-line transports
   - We implemented placeholder classes for these transports
   - Future work should involve properly implementing these transport mechanisms

## Solutions

1. **Import Paths**:
   - Updated import statements in `mcp_handler.py` to match the actual SDK structure
   - Created placeholder classes for missing functionality

2. **Testing Approach**:
   - Created a simplified test that just verifies the handler can be instantiated
   - Future tests should be written with the actual SDK structure in mind

3. **Documentation**:
   - Added notes to the codebase explaining the SDK structure
   - Updated requirements.txt with information about the SDK version

## Next Steps

1. Implement proper transport classes for HTTP+SSE and command-line
2. Expand test coverage for the MCPHandler class
3. Update the Agent class to interact correctly with the MCPHandler
4. Document the MCP integration in the project documentation
