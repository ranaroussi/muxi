# AI Agent Framework: Next Steps

## What We've Accomplished

We've successfully implemented the core components of our AI agent framework:

1. **Modern Control Protocol (MCP)**: Implemented the MCP for standardized communication with LLMs
2. **Memory System**:
   - Buffer memory using FAISS for short-term context
   - Long-term memory using PostgreSQL with pgvector
   - Memobase system for multi-user support with partitioned memories
3. **Tool System**:
   - Base tool interface
   - Tool registry for managing tools
   - Example tools (Calculator, Web Search)
4. **Agent Class**: Main interface combining LLM, memory, and tools
5. **Orchestrator**: For managing multiple agents and their interactions
6. **Configuration System**: For loading and managing configuration
7. **Example Script**: To demonstrate how to use the framework
8. **Real-Time Communication**:
   - WebSocket server for real-time agent interaction
   - Proper message serialization for MCP messages
   - Shared orchestrator instance between REST API and WebSocket server
   - Resilient connection handling with automatic reconnection
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Support for multi-user WebSocket connections
9. **API Improvements**:
   - REST API for agent management and interaction
   - Multi-user support endpoints
   - Memory management endpoints including search and clear
   - Comprehensive test coverage

## Next Steps

Here are the next steps to further enhance the framework:

### 1. LLM Providers

- Implement OpenAILLM LLM provider
- Implement Anthropic LLM provider
- Add support for local models (e.g., Llama, Mistral)
- Create a model router for fallback and cost optimization

### 2. Additional Tools

- File operations tool
- Email tool
- Calendar tool
- Document processing tool
- Image generation tool
- Browser automation tool

### 3. Testing

- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests
- Performance benchmarks
- Test different LLM providers

### 4. Documentation

- API documentation
- User guides
- Tool development guide
- Example projects

### 5. Advanced Features

- **Multi-agent collaboration**: Enable agents to work together
- **Planning and reasoning**: Implement planning capabilities
- **Continuous learning**: Update agent knowledge over time
- **Evaluation framework**: Measure agent performance
- **Security enhancements**: Implement sandboxing and permissions
- **User feedback integration**: Learn from user interactions

### 6. Deployment
