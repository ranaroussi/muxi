# AI Agent Framework: Next Steps

## What We've Accomplished

We've successfully implemented the core components of our AI agent framework:

1. **Modern Control Protocol (MCP)**: Implemented the MCP for standardized communication with LLMs
2. **Memory System**:
   - Buffer memory using FAISS for short-term context
   - Long-term memory using PostgreSQL with pgvector
3. **Tool System**:
   - Base tool interface
   - Tool registry for managing tools
   - Example tools (Calculator, Web Search)
4. **Agent Class**: Main interface combining LLM, memory, and tools
5. **Orchestrator**: For managing multiple agents and their interactions
6. **Configuration System**: For loading and managing configuration
7. **Example Script**: To demonstrate how to use the framework

## Next Steps

Here are the next steps to further enhance the framework:

### 1. LLM Providers

- Implement OpenAILLM LLM provider
- Implement Anthropic LLM provider
- Add support for local models (e.g., Llama, Mistral)
- Create a model router for fallback and cost optimization

### 2. Additional Tools

- File operations tool
- Email tool
- Calendar tool
- Document processing tool
- Image generation tool
- Browser automation tool

### 3. Testing

- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests
- Performance benchmarks
- Test different LLM providers

### 4. Documentation

- API documentation
- User guides
- Tool development guide
- Example projects

### 5. Advanced Features

- **Multi-agent collaboration**: Enable agents to work together
- **Planning and reasoning**: Implement planning capabilities
- **Continuous learning**: Update agent knowledge over time
- **Evaluation framework**: Measure agent performance
- **Security enhancements**: Implement sandboxing and permissions
- **User feedback integration**: Learn from user interactions

### 6. Deployment

- Docker containerization
- Kubernetes deployment
- Cloud deployment guides (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Monitoring and logging integration

### 7. User Interfaces

- [x] CLI interface
- [ ] Web dashboard
- [x] API server
- [x] WebSocket support for real-time communication

## Contribution Guidelines

If you'd like to contribute to the framework, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Code Style**: Follow PEP 8 guidelines
2. **Documentation**: Document all public functions, classes, and methods
3. **Testing**: Write tests for all new features
4. **Pull Requests**: Create a pull request with a clear description of changes
5. **Issues**: Use GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests

## Roadmap Timeline

- **Q1**: Complete LLM providers and additional tools
- **Q2**: Testing, documentation, and advanced features
- **Q3**: Deployment and user interfaces
- **Q4**: Community building and ecosystem development
