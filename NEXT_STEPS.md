## End-to-End Scenarios

### Simple Agent with Configuration Files

This scenario demonstrates a complete workflow from installation to running an agent using the new configuration-based approach:

1. **Install the Framework**
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/muxi.git
   cd muxi

   # Install dependencies
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. **Create a Configuration File**
   Create a file `configs/my_agent.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   name: my_assistant
   system_message: You are a helpful assistant with weather capabilities.
   model:
     provider: openai
     api_key: "${OPENAI_API_KEY}"
     model: gpt-4o
     temperature: 0.7
   memory:
     buffer: 10  # Buffer window size of 10
     long_term: true  # Enable long-term memory
   tools:
   - enable_calculator
   - enable_web_search
   mcp_servers:
   - name: weather
     url: http://localhost:5001
     credentials:
     - id: weather_api_key
       param_name: api_key
       required: true
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/muxi
   WEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_api_key
   ```

4. **Create a Simple Application**
   Create a file `app.py`:
   ```python
   from dotenv import load_dotenv
   from src import muxi

   # Load environment variables
   load_dotenv()

   # Initialize MUXI - the database connection will be loaded
   # automatically from DATABASE_URL when needed
   mx = muxi()

   # Add agent from configuration
   mx.add_agent("assistant", "configs/my_agent.yaml")

   # Interactive mode - explicitly specify the agent (optional)
   response = mx.chat("What's the weather like in London?", agent_name="assistant")
   print(f"Response: {response}")

   # Let the orchestrator automatically select the appropriate agent (recommended)
   response = mx.chat("What's the weather like in New York?")
   print(f"Response: {response}")

   # Or start a server
   # mx.start_server(port=5050)
   ```

5. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

This approach significantly reduces the amount of code needed while providing powerful configuration options through YAML or JSON files.
