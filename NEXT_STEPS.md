# Developer Tasks and Implementation Checklist

This document provides a detailed task tracker for developers working on the MUXI Framework. It contains specific implementation tasks, checklists, and tracks completed work. For the high-level strategic vision and roadmap, see the `docs/Strategic_Roadmap.md` file.

## Completed Work

Core components of the muxi framework now implemented:

1. **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Standardized communication with LLMs
2. **Memory System**:
   - Buffer memory using FAISS for short-term context
   - Long-term memory using PostgreSQL with pgvector
   - Memobase system for multi-user support with partitioned memories
   - Domain knowledge system for user-specific structured information
3. **Tool System**:
   - Base tool interface
   - Tool registry for managing tools
   - Example tools (Calculator, Web Search)
4. **Agent Class**: Main interface combining LLM, memory, and tools
5. **Orchestrator**: For managing multiple agents and their interactions
6. **Configuration System**: For loading and managing configuration
7. **Example Script**: To demonstrate how to use the framework
8. **Real-Time Communication**:
   - WebSocket server for real-time agent interaction
   - Proper message serialization for MCP messages
   - Shared orchestrator instance between REST API and WebSocket server
   - Resilient connection handling with automatic reconnection
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Support for multi-user WebSocket connections
9. **API Improvements**:
   - REST API for agent management and interaction
   - Multi-user support endpoints
   - Memory management endpoints including search and clear
   - Comprehensive test coverage
10. **Command Line Interface**:
    - Rich terminal-based interface for agent interaction
    - Commands for chat, one-off messages, and server management
    - Colored output with Markdown support
    - Convenient launcher for API server and web UI
11. **Code Quality**:
    - Resolved deprecation warnings for SQLAlchemy and FastAPI
    - Standardized line length configuration across linting tools
    - Improved VS Code integration with consistent formatting rules
