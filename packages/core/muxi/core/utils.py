# Title:        Utilities - Common Helper Functions
# Description:  General utility functions used throughout the Muxi framework
# Role:         Provides reusable functionality for common operations
# Usage:        Imported by various components that need utility functions
# Author:       Muxi Framework Team
#
# The utils.py file provides a collection of utility functions that are used
# across the Muxi framework. These functions handle common operations such as:
#
# 1. File Operations
#    - Document loading from various file formats
#    - Content extraction and processing
#    - Format detection and handling
#
# 2. Text Processing
#    - Text chunking with overlap for context preservation
#    - Paragraph handling and processing
#    - Size management for LLM context windows
#
# These utilities are designed to be reusable, efficient, and handle edge
# cases appropriately. They abstract common patterns used throughout the
# framework to maintain consistency and reduce code duplication.
#
# Example usage:
#
#   from muxi.core.utils import load_document, chunk_text
#
#   # Load a document from a file
#   content = load_document("path/to/document.txt")
#
#   # Chunk the content for processing
#   chunks = chunk_text(content, chunk_size=2000, overlap=150)

def load_document(file_path: str) -> str:
    """
    Load a document from a file.

    This function reads the content of a file and returns it as a string.
    It handles different file types based on their extensions, with special
    handling for common text formats.

    Args:
        file_path: Path to the file to be loaded. Can be absolute or relative path.
            Supports various text formats including .txt, .md, and .markdown.

    Returns:
        The document content as a string, ready for processing.

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the file does not exist or cannot be accessed.
        ValueError: If the file format is not supported or cannot be read as text.
            Binary files and certain document formats may not be supported.

def chunk_text(text: str, chunk_size: int = 1000, overlap: int = 200) -> List[str]:
    """
    Split text into chunks with overlap.

    This function divides a large text into smaller chunks while maintaining
    context between chunks through overlapping content. It attempts to use
    paragraph breaks as natural division points to preserve semantic coherence.

    Args:
        text: The text to chunk into smaller pieces. Can be any string content
            including documents, transcripts, or other textual data.
        chunk_size: Maximum size (in characters) of each chunk. Default is 1000,
            which works well for most embedding and processing purposes.
        overlap: Number of characters to overlap between consecutive chunks. This
            helps maintain context across chunk boundaries. Default is 200 characters.

    Returns:
        List of text chunks with specified overlap. Each chunk is a string of
        size â‰¤ chunk_size, with the last overlap characters of each chunk
        appearing at the beginning of the next chunk (when applicable).
        Returns an empty list if input text is empty.
